## Limbic Examples

This folder includes some examples on how to use the `limbic` package. You can either go directly to the jupyter notebook, 
or you can read through them in markdown format (useful when using mobile devices which can't render notebooks).

Current examples are the following:
* Basic example
* Game of Thrones analysis
