1
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:07,966
<i>How many of those fingers</i>

2
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:10,418
<i>do you think we could</i>
<i>shove up his ass?</i>

3
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:12,187
<i>Depends if he's had</i>
<i>any practice.</i>

4
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:16,191
Is that the sort of thing
you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

5
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:19,945
She loosened you up for us?

6
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,403
He's going to fall.

7
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:31,039
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

8
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:42,116
Water.

9
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,135
Water.

10
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,788
Please, water.

11
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,307
Wa-water.

12
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:50,976
Water, please.

13
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,927
Please. Please.

14
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:02,470
If I die,
you won't be getting--

15
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,938
Oh, enough.

16
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,074
Here.

17
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:15,283
Can't say that I've ever
seen a man drink horse piss that fast.

18
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,562
Stop!

19
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:53,872
Far enough.

20
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:27,906
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

21
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:34,162
Come on, you.

22
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,458
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

23
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:48,593
I hope we might speak.

24
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,296
In confidence.

25
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:54,248
Oh, always in confidence.

26
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,017
About the events
of the Blackwater.

27
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,020
Perhaps this is
the wrong time?

28
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:00,922
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

29
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:03,608
I thought one
of your little birds

30
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:06,427
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

31
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,929
End your life?

32
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,782
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

33
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,367
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

34
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,435
Which is why
I'm coming to you.

35
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:16,704
- I need proof.
- Proof?

36
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:19,124
 - Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

37
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,277
I have no proof,
only whispers.

38
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,884
Before all this nastiness,

39
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,471
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

40
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,223
 Do you want
 to hear it still?

41
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,642
I don't know.
Do I?

42
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,428
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

43
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,430
through the Free Cities.

44
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,232
One day in Myr,

45
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:47,101
a certain man
made my master an offer

46
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,187
too tempting to refuse.

47
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,806
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

48
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:53,825
some men used small boys.

49
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,578
But what he wanted
was far worse.

50
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,247
He gave me a potion

51
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,366
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

52
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:04,419
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

53
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,838
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

54
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,824
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

55
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:13,461
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

56
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,013
The flames turned blue

57
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,716
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

58
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,225
I still dream of that night.

59
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,694
Not of the sorcerer,

60
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,013
not of his blade.

61
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,482
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

62
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:36,701
Was it a god?
A demon?

63
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,403
A conjuror's trick?

64
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,572
I don't know.

65
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:44,075
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

66
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:46,527
And ever since that day,

67
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:50,331
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

68
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,750
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

69
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:56,170
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

70
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:59,891
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

71
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:03,978
Yes, ahem.
I feel the need for actual revenge

72
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,014
against the actual person

73
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,549
who tried
to have me killed.

74
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,903
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

75
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:14,272
You do not possess

76
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,025
at the moment.

77
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,360
But influence is largely

78
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:22,530
a matter of patience,
I have found.

79
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,917
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

80
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,536
he threw me out
of his house to die.

81
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,289
I resolved to live

82
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,757
to spite him.

83
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,342
<i>I begged.</i>

84
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:37,578
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

85
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,931
I became
an excellent thief

86
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:43,351
and soon learned
that the contents of a man's letters

87
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:47,438
<i>are more valuable</i>
<i>than the contents of his purse.</i>

88
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,924
Step by step,

89
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:52,727
one distasteful task
after another,

90
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,230
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

91
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:59,484
to the small council chamber.

92
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:04,372
Influence grows like a weed.

93
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:08,126
I tended mine patiently

94
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,546
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

95
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,916
all the way across
to the far side of the world

96
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,886
where I managed to wrap
them around something

97
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,005
very special.

98
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:28,680
The sorcerer.

99
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:32,133
Hello, my old friend.

100
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:35,353
 <i>It's been a long time.</i>

101
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,573
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

102
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,158
will be yours in time...

103
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,244
if you have
the stomach for it.

104
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,649
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

105
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,119
they never mention
the shoveling.

106
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,371
Or the shit.

107
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:56,124
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

108
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:57,542
and protecting the realm,

109
00:08:57,593 --> 00:09:01,929
but shoveling
really is most of it.

110
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:05,666
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

111
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:08,169
And that.
But when you're not getting attacked or killed,

112
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,503
usually you're shoveling.

113
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:12,306
Oh, look.

114
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,058
More shit.

115
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,011
I was starting
to wonder what to do

116
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,813
with the rest of my day.

117
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,182
We need to get
out of here.

118
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,702
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

119
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:27,688
The Lord Commander
told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.

120
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,524
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

121
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,026
We do now.

122
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,745
We know what's out there.

123
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,831
Craster's been out here
surviving.

124
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,467
So he's your new protector now?

125
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,002
Our good friend Craster?

126
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,720
We're like the sons
he never had.

127
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:45,339
<i>Mormont isn't</i>
<i>gonna save you.</i>

128
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:48,709
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

129
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,061
When the walkers
come calling,

130
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,764
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

131
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,150
If we want to live...

132
00:09:58,353 --> 00:10:00,772
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

133
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,075
Shh, shh, shh.

134
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,755
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,243
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

136
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,766
He's beautiful.

137
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,852
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

138
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:34,472
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

139
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:36,057
Why?

140
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:42,196
Here.

141
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,615
- Gilly.
- You said to hold it for you until you came back.

142
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,200
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

143
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:48,202
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

144
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:51,489
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,574
Can you?

146
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,495
I don't have time
for you.

147
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,831
I don't have time
for anyone but him

148
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:03,084
because he doesn't
have much time.

149
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,495
You have to go
after him.

150
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,413
How?

151
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,499
<i>You know how.</i>

152
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,341
Brandon.

153
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:03,778
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

154
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,197
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

155
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:07,982
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

156
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,951
No more climbing.
Promise me.

157
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:11,652
Promise me!
Promise me!

158
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:13,988
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

159
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:15,239
<i>Promise me!</i>

160
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:30,588
Is he very large?

161
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,390
No larger than usual,
apparently.

162
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:35,476
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

163
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,095
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

164
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:39,564
And they've had
a lot of men.

165
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:41,599
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

166
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,185
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

167
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,770
Seems a bit simple?

168
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,823
What did he do to them?

169
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,107
I don't know, my lord.

170
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,526
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

171
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,495
So what did they say?

172
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,564
They said it was hard
to describe.

173
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,166
Huh.

174
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:03,921
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

175
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:08,175
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

176
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,261
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

177
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,597
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

178
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,131
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

179
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,767
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

180
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:20,304
of the Lady Arryn
and the title that comes with her.

181
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,440
Sad, really.

182
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,442
Is that all it takes

183
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,594
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

184
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,148
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

185
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,984
as far as I know.

186
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:35,653
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

187
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:37,788
What makes you say so?

188
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:42,209
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

189
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,496
You can read.

190
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,614
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

191
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,635
- Former profession.
- Of course.

192
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:54,255
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

193
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,173
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

194
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:58,759
He's bringing
two featherbeds for the cabin.

195
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:03,097
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

196
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:05,933
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

197
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,185
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

198
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:10,521
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

199
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:12,306
How do you know?

200
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:14,742
Because I'm one
of his girls.

201
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:18,195
Prodigies in
odd places indeed.

202
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:22,750
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

203
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,252
or rather his dragon.

204
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,872
It ate her
while her son watched.

205
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:32,760
What's left of her
is buried in the crypts right down there.

206
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:38,849
<i>The ceremony is traditionally</i>
<i>held in the main sanctum,</i>

207
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:42,136
which seats
700 comfortably.

208
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,838
There appears to be a good
deal of room elsewhere

209
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:47,475
on the premises
for everyone else.

210
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,677
There aren't more than 700 people
of any importance.

211
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,847
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

212
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,900
upon the 700
to remind them

213
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,120
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

214
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,654
Over there in that urn,

215
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:03,023
the ashes
of Aerion Targaryen.

216
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,025
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

217
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:08,212
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

218
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,465
He was wrong.

219
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,534
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

220
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,302
killed by my uncle.

221
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:18,539
Would you like to see where the last
Targaryens are buried?

222
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:21,542
Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

223
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,310
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

224
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,896
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

225
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:28,232
It's like taking a walk
through history.

226
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,522
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

227
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:36,190
You were married here,
Your Grace?

228
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:39,393
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

229
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,195
Seems like a lifetime ago.

230
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:43,531
Your husband,
was he buried here as well?

231
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,700
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

232
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:50,287
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

233
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,872
Hunting and drinking
don't mix.

234
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:53,457
I should say not.

235
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,576
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

236
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,462
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

237
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:01,465
I seem to recall
he laid siege to Storm's End

238
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:03,050
for the better part
of a year.

239
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,802
All he laid siege to

240
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,138
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

241
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,424
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

242
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:13,944
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

243
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,431
We mothers
do what we can

244
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,617
to keep our sons
from the grave.

245
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,652
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

246
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,438
We shower them
with good sense,

247
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:27,958
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

248
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:30,961
And yet the world
belongs to them.

249
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:33,914
A ridiculous arrangement,
to my mind.

250
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,804
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

251
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:43,507
My father didn't
want them here.

252
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,176
He was going to have
their bodies burned

253
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:46,894
and thrown
in the Blackwater,

254
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:50,431
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

255
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,099
I'm glad he did.

256
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,486
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

257
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,271
I know they did
terrible things at the end,

258
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:01,192
but their ancestors
built this.

259
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,029
Sometimes severity

260
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,198
is the price we pay
for greatness.

261
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,535
I couldn't agree more.

262
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,597
Shall we go and see them?

263
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:26,050
If you give them
your love,

264
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:29,520
they will return it
a thousandfold.

265
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:32,056
I've spoken with them.

266
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,441
I know how they feel
about you.

267
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:37,895
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

268
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,649
They adore you.

269
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,192
Open the doors.

270
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,535
Joffrey.

271
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,338
Wait.

272
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,308
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

273
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:10,094
Bless you,
Lady Margaery!

274
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:12,563
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

275
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,649
- <i>Margaery!</i>
- <i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

276
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,185
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

277
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,440
<i>King Joffrey!</i>
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

278
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,576
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

279
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,894
 <i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

280
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,619
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

281
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,237
Not far, my lord.

282
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:39,206
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

283
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,074
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

284
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:44,929
I served them,
the men who were torturing you.

285
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:47,548
I did what they told me and waited
for the right moment.

286
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,934
Why would you risk
your life for me?

287
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,970
I grew up
on Saltcliffe, my lord.

288
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:56,140
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

289
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,142
My father brought me
and my brothers up to the bluffs

290
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,195
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

291
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,264
I remember the look
on my father's face when he told us,

292
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:07,100
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

293
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:10,821
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

294
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:13,157
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

295
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,209
Those men,

296
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:18,245
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

297
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,132
Did he?

298
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,118
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

299
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:28,622
They-- they never
told me much.

300
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:39,233
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

301
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,435
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

302
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:43,487
Not all those
are your sister's men.

303
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,240
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

304
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:51,578
What is it?

305
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,197
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

306
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:55,366
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

307
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,150
What did he tell
you to do?

308
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:59,420
Raid fishing villages.

309
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,288
He didn't trust me.

310
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,090
Thought I was a Stark.

311
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:06,043
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

312
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:08,545
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

313
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:11,098
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

314
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:14,301
All he had to do was be.

315
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:18,338
Be who he was born to be.

316
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:20,841
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

317
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,360
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

318
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,679
<i>He's the King</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

319
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:27,013
<i>And me...</i>

320
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:29,700
my father gave me
a choice

321
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,652
and I made it.

322
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,988
I could never
be a Stark.

323
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:38,492
But ironborn,

324
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:41,161
that's what
I was born to be.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,585
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

326
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,210
I murdered those boys.

327
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,099
The Stark boys?

328
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,218
Never found them.

329
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,856
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

330
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:15,079
I let Dagmer
slit their throats

331
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:17,281
and I let him
burn the bodies...

332
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,735
so I could keep
Winterfell...

333
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:26,256
and make my father proud.

334
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,760
Maybe it's not too late.

335
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:34,932
It is.

336
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,976
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

337
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,063
I made a choice...

338
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,618
and I chose wrong.

339
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:59,790
And now I've burned
everything down.

340
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,827
Not everything,
my lord.

341
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:07,965
She's up here.

342
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:22,896
- Yara.
- <i>Shh.</i>

343
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:24,464
Wait.

344
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,576
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

345
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,444
What?
No, I didn't.

346
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:39,646
You can't!

347
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:42,366
No, please stop!

348
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,704
No!

349
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,506
Put him back
where he belongs.

350
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,482
Eat.

351
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,021
What are you doing?

352
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,657
I'm dying.

353
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,660
You can't die.

354
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,996
You need to live

355
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,498
to take revenge.

356
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:34,001
I don't care
about revenge.

357
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:36,003
You coward.

358
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,923
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

359
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,543
Misfor--

360
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,145
misfortune?

361
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,930
You lost your hand.

362
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:49,716
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

363
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:54,271
You have a taste--

364
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:57,024
one taste
of the real world

365
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:00,160
where people have
important things taken from them

366
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:02,946
and you whine
and cry and quit.

367
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,449
You sound like
a bloody woman.

368
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,477
I know what
you did for me.

369
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:37,764
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

370
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:43,737
It's called
the Sapphire Isle

371
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,939
because of the blue
of its water.

372
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,044
You knew that.

373
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,504
Why did you help me?

374
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,314
You wanted to speak to me?

375
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,701
Yes, about Jaime.

376
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,370
What about him?

377
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:34,821
I wanted to make sure

378
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,290
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

379
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:43,496
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

380
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,833
what did I do
in response?

381
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:49,886
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

382
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,305
for that lecherous
little stump,

383
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,508
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

384
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:58,195
Whatever you can.

385
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:01,014
Whatever I can.

386
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,128
- You're still here.
- Yes.

387
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:20,300
Why?

388
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,718
Did it ever occur to you

389
00:26:21,753 --> 00:26:23,754
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

390
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:26,256
and your trust,
not your sons?

391
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:29,176
Not Jaime or Tyrion,
but me.

392
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,395
Years and years
of lectures on family

393
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,513
and legacy--

394
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:35,048
the same lecture,
really,

395
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:38,384
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

396
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,153
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

397
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:43,857
might be the only one listening to them?
Living by them?

398
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:47,444
That she might have
the most to contribute to your legacy

399
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:50,396
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

400
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:00,540
All right.
Contribute.

401
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,295
The Tyrells are a problem.

402
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:09,916
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

403
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:13,220
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

404
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:16,940
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

405
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,944
She knows how
to manipulate him.

406
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,362
Good.

407
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,481
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

408
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,452
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

409
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,988
I distrust you because you're not as smart
as you think you are.

410
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,791
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

411
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,794
and everyone else
in this city.

412
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,168
Perhaps...

413
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:48,672
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

414
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,145
I will.

415
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,398
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

416
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:01,301
Another golden rose.
How original.

417
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,737
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

418
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:05,972
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

419
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,875
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

420
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,311
as if that makes it
smell any better.

421
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,996
Roses are boring, dear.

422
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,582
"Growing strong."

423
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:18,702
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

424
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,653
"Winter is coming!"

425
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,706
Now that's memorable.

426
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:25,825
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

427
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,844
Those are houses
you watch out for.

428
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,048
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

429
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:34,100
But a golden rose
growing strong--

430
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:37,503
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

431
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:41,975
Look, little loves.

432
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:43,894
A spider in the garden.

433
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,730
Run along now.

434
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,698
Grow strong.

435
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:52,285
My lady.

436
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,655
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

437
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,158
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

438
00:28:58,192 --> 00:29:01,244
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

439
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:03,663
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

440
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:05,248
Are you here
to seduce me?

441
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,967
A little obvious,
perhaps.

442
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,885
Oh, no, please.

443
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,305
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

444
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,707
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

445
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:18,378
What happens when the nonexistent bumps
against the decrepit?

446
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,681
A question for
the philosophers.

447
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:24,734
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

448
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,903
- So?
- Might I sit?

449
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,855
No.

450
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:32,058
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

451
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,778
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

452
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,564
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

453
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:39,732
Have I?

454
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,618
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

455
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,570
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

456
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:45,905
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

457
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,707
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

458
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,542
No, not particularly.

459
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:51,595
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

460
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,414
She has, sadly.

461
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:56,749
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

462
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:00,103
I thought we shared certain hopes for
her well-being.

463
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:01,605
Come, come.

464
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:04,224
You surrender
rather easily.

465
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:07,093
Walk with me.

466
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:08,862
I know the walls
have ears,

467
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,231
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

468
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:14,067
I choose my allies
carefully

469
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:17,070
and my enemies
more carefully still.

470
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:18,989
Which is Sansa Stark?

471
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,825
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

472
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:24,077
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

473
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:26,212
Ned Stark
had many admirers,

474
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:27,664
and how many
stepped forward

475
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:30,283
when the executioner
came for his head?

476
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:31,885
I could not help
Lord Stark.

477
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,138
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

478
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:38,642
You're not the only one who has
taken an interest in her.

479
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:40,460
That's hardly surprising.

480
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,812
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

481
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:46,399
Indeed. She'd make a lovely match
for the right suitor.

482
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:49,302
It almost feels as if you're about
to arrive at the point.

483
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,971
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

484
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,990
A confidant of mine
has told me

485
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:56,943
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

486
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:59,279
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

487
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:03,116
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

488
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,868
He has acquired
the first two.

489
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,652
How long before
he has the army?

490
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:08,788
Perhaps you'll laugh,

491
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:10,840
but I know him
better than most

492
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,093
and this is the truth.

493
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:17,714
Littlefinger is one
of the most dangerous men in Westeros.

494
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:20,133
If Robb Stark falls,

495
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,552
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

496
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,555
And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have
the key in his pocket.

497
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:27,357
Which seems such a shame.

498
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,476
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

499
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,511
steal away
such a lovely bride?

500
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:33,613
You must despise him.

501
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,782
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

502
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:38,735
Actually,
I rather enjoy him.

503
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:40,870
But he would see
this country burn

504
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:43,323
if he could be
king of the ashes.

505
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,375
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

506
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,960
You are too kind.

507
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:49,913
I believe I have
a possible solution.

508
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:51,715
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

509
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,333
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

510
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:06,513
Ahem.

511
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:08,565
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

512
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,350
You haven't.

513
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:12,152
We'd like
some privacy, please.

514
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:14,387
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

515
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:18,825
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

516
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,745
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

517
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,450
What did you pray for?

518
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,120
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

519
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:32,872
I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

520
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:36,709
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

521
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:39,963
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

522
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:42,632
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

523
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:46,469
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

524
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,087
My cousin Alanna

525
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:50,640
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

526
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:52,809
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

527
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,311
and Alanna looked
like a goddess sent to torture me.

528
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:57,147
Pig-face, she called me.

529
00:32:57,198 --> 00:32:59,065
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

530
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,317
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

531
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,769
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

532
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:09,626
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

533
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,111
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

534
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:14,747
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

535
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:17,167
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

536
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:20,003
and eventually your face
slides off and you die in agony.

537
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:21,954
But that's awful.

538
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,676
You're--

539
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:28,678
I believed you!

540
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,630
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

541
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,849
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

542
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,485
So what happened
to Alanna?

543
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,637
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

544
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:40,607
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

545
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,442
and live in a castle
by the sea.

546
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:45,078
It's all terribly
frustrating.

547
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:47,813
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

548
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:50,116
You'll be married
here in the capital

549
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,819
and she'll have to come
watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.

550
00:33:56,624 --> 00:34:00,376
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

551
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,629
That would make me
very happy.

552
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,099
You must see Highgarden.

553
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,167
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

554
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,104
We have a great masquerade the night
of the harvest moon.

555
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:12,555
You should see
the costumes.

556
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:14,307
People work on them
for months.

557
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:17,777
I-- I don't think
the queen

558
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,312
would let me leave
King's Landing.

559
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,147
The Queen Regent,
you mean.

560
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,533
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

561
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:29,656
And if you were
to marry Loras...

562
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:35,861
Oh, your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

563
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,249
We would be sisters,
you and I.

564
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,217
Would you like that?

565
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:57,717
His name was Bannen.

566
00:34:57,735 --> 00:34:59,435
He was a good man,

567
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:01,404
a good ranger.

568
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:03,573
He came to us from--

569
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,226
where did he come from?

570
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,996
Down White Harbor way.

571
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,165
He came to us
from White Harbor.

572
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,234
Never failed
in his duty.

573
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:18,371
He kept his vows
the best he could.

574
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:22,292
He rode far,
fought fiercely.

575
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,846
We shall never see
his like again.

576
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,300
And now his watch
has ended.

577
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:34,103
And now his watch
has ended.

578
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:41,728
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

579
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:44,614
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

580
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,317
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

581
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:49,152
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

582
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,603
<i>You on his side?</i>

583
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:53,706
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

584
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:56,326
We're brothers of the Night's Watch,
not thieves.

585
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,211
The day we leave,

586
00:35:58,245 --> 00:36:01,831
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

587
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:05,001
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

588
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:07,003
<i>and laugh at us</i>

589
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:09,288
starving in the snow.

590
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,977
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

591
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,016
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

592
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:34,163
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

593
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,950
I had my 99th.

594
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:42,121
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

595
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:47,377
And more daughters
than I can count.

596
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,829
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

597
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:53,516
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

598
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,635
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

599
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:57,603
Ah.

600
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:59,722
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

601
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:03,026
Them that's dying,

602
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,177
why don't you cut their throats
and be done with it?

603
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,179
<i>Hmm?</i>

604
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:10,400
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

605
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:11,984
and I'll sort them myself.

606
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,188
<i>Whose throat you</i>
<i>gonna cut, old man?</i>

607
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:20,960
Wait outside.

608
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:24,380
It's cold outside
and there's nothing to eat.

609
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:25,915
My wives gave you bread.

610
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:29,201
There's sawdust
in the bread.

611
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,753
You don't like it,

612
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:33,172
you go out there
and eat the snow.

613
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:41,898
I'd rather eat what you've got
hidden away.

614
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:46,986
I told you
to wait outside.

615
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,855
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

616
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:50,573
eating his fill
while we die.

617
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:54,243
I gave you crows enough.

618
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:55,561
I've got to feed
my women!

619
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:57,497
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

620
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,998
How else'd you make it
through winter?

621
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:02,034
Enough!
Out!

622
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:03,920
I am a godly man.

623
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:05,455
You're a stingy bastard!

624
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:06,873
Bastard?

625
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:10,409
Out with you,
you little thief.

626
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:13,796
And you!
And you!

627
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,083
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

628
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:22,221
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

629
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:24,590
who calls me bastard.

630
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,290
You are a bastard.

631
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:47,463
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

632
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:57,289
The gods will
curse us for this.

633
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:00,643
- By all the laws--
- There are no laws beyond the Wall.

634
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,228
Now show us where
he hides the food

635
00:39:02,262 --> 00:39:04,347
or you'll get
the same as he did.

636
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,799
Unhand her.

637
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,684
I shall have
your head for this.

638
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:02,521
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

639
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:06,125
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

640
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:13,833
Follow me.
I know the best way.

641
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:17,536
Come on.

642
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,144
Run fast, Piggy,

643
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:27,480
and sleep well!

644
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:30,433
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

645
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,273
Can I take
this hood off yet?

646
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:39,058
I do apologize,
little lady,

647
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:41,777
but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.

648
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:45,948
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

649
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,285
Halt!

650
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:57,209
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

651
00:40:58,078 --> 00:40:59,745
Ugh!

652
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:02,048
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

653
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,933
I'd have some.

654
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,938
Let's go home.

655
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:27,740
<i>What is this place?</i>

656
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:30,876
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

657
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:42,638
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

658
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:44,724
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>were swineherds.</i>

659
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:47,426
And some of us tanners
and masons.

660
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,811
That was before.

661
00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:50,796
You're still swineherds

662
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:53,733
and tanners
and masons.

663
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,769
You think carrying
a crooked spear makes you a soldier?

664
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,989
No.

665
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:03,326
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

666
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,411
Beric Dondarrion?

667
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:07,146
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

668
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:09,699
And I won't see them again.

669
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:13,119
Stark deserters.

670
00:42:13,153 --> 00:42:15,755
Baratheon deserters.

671
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:17,340
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

672
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:18,874
You're running from it.

673
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:21,210
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

674
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:25,131
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

675
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,849
Which of us is running?

676
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:28,968
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

677
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:32,688
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

678
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:35,524
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

679
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,859
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

680
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:39,362
Ned Stark is dead.

681
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:41,647
King Robert is dead.

682
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:43,866
My brother's alive.

683
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:48,070
You're fighting
for ghosts.

684
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:49,989
That's what we are--

685
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:53,859
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

686
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:56,245
You can't see us,

687
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:58,214
but we see you.

688
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:00,532
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

689
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,202
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

690
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,221
you prey on the weak,

691
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:08,090
the Brotherhood
without Banners will hunt you down.

692
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:10,176
You found god?
Is that it?

693
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,845
Aye.
I've been reborn

694
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,847
in the light
of the one true god.

695
00:43:15,682 --> 00:43:17,382
<i>As have we all.</i>

696
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:19,902
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

697
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:22,655
If you mean to murder me,
then bloody well get on with it.

698
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:25,858
You'll die
soon enough, dog.

699
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:29,412
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

700
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:31,396
<i>And a kinder fate</i>
<i>than you deserve.</i>

701
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:32,915
<i>Lions you call</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

702
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:36,168
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of 7 years were raped

703
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,421
<i>and babes</i>
<i>still on the breast</i>

704
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:40,122
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

705
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:42,425
I wasn't at
the Mummer's Ford.

706
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,960
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

707
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:47,379
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

708
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:49,932
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

709
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,517
before the Iron Throne.

710
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,269
Do you take me
for my brother?

711
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:55,771
Is being born
Clegane a crime?

712
00:43:55,806 --> 00:43:58,858
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

713
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:01,694
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

714
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:03,595
never heard them bawling.

715
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:07,283
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

716
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:09,368
But don't call me murderer

717
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:11,237
and pretend that you're not.

718
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,289
You murdered Mycah.

719
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:14,824
The butcher's boy.

720
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,792
My friend.

721
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:20,079
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

722
00:44:20,113 --> 00:44:21,464
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

723
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:24,216
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

724
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:26,802
Aye, he was a bleeder.

725
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:29,555
You don't deny
killing this boy?

726
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:31,223
I was Joffrey's
sworn shield.

727
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:33,259
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

728
00:44:33,293 --> 00:44:36,679
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

729
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,347
Then I should have
killed you.

730
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:41,600
Not my place
to question princes.

731
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:45,104
You stand accused of murder.

732
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:47,472
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

733
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:49,825
so it is not for us
to judge you.

734
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,661
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

735
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:57,333
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

736
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:01,820
So, who will it be?

737
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:04,757
Should we find out
if your fire god

738
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:07,092
really loves you, priest?

739
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:10,679
Or you, archer?
What are you worth with a sword in your hand?

740
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:14,683
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

741
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:18,804
Aye.

742
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:20,890
She might be.

743
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,060
But it's me you'll fight.

744
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:51,303
The master says
they are untested.

745
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:57,509
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

746
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:00,145
There are many small cities
between here and there,

747
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,264
cities ripe for sacking.

748
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:06,235
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

749
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:09,438
the masters will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

750
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:15,527
<i>And who knows?</i>

751
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:19,665
In 10 years,
some of the boys you send them

752
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,900
may be Unsullied
in their turn.

753
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:24,069
Thus all shall prosper.

754
00:47:17,623 --> 00:47:20,809
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

755
00:47:23,763 --> 00:47:27,433
<i>It is done.</i>

756
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:29,151
You hold the whip.

757
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,244
Dracarys.
