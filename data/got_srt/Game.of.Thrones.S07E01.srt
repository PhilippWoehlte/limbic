1
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,071
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

2
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:39,530
After all, we just had a feast.

3
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,488
Since when does old Walder

4
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:45,488
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

5
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,947
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

6
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:53,321
if you can't celebrate with your family.

7
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:54,822
That's what I say!

8
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:58,238
Yes!

9
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:05,988
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

10
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:11,321
so I can tell you my
plans for this great house

11
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,196
now that winter has come.

12
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:17,364
But first, a toast!

13
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:22,613
No more of that Dornish horse piss!

14
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,571
This is the finest Arbor gold!

15
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:28,571
Proper wine for proper heroes!

16
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,947
Stand together!

17
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,197
Stand together!

18
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,363
Not you.

19
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm not wasting good
wine on a damn woman.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,321
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.

21
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:02,738
I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.

22
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,863
You're my family, the men who helped me

23
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:08,905
slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

24
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:13,029
Yes, yes.

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,697
Cheer.

26
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:19,029
Brave men, all of you.

27
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,613
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

28
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:28,446
Cut the throat of a mother of five.

29
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,571
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

30
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,322
into your home.

31
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,613
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

32
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:45,363
No, no, that was your mistake.

33
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:49,238
You should have ripped
them all out, root and stem.

34
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,113
Leave one wolf alive

35
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,781
and the sheep are never safe.

36
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,698
When people ask you
what happened here...

37
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,989
tell them the North remembers.

38
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:37,322
Tell them winter came for House Frey.

39
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:42,941

41
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,530
You wildlings?

42
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,447
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

43
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,947
This is Brandon Stark,

44
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,155
son of Ned Stark.

45
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,989
How do I know that's true?

46
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:22,488
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

47
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:23,948
You were at Hardhome.

48
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,823
You've seen the Army of the Dead.

49
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:31,072
You've seen the Night King.

50
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,155
He's coming for us.

51
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,489
For all of us.

52
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,238
Okay, come on.

53
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,322
Let's get them inside.

54
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,613
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

55
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,780
for any mention of dragonglass.

56
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,863
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

57
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,530
It's more valuable to us now than gold.

58
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,196
We need to find it, we need to mine it,

59
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,906
we need to make weapons from it.

60
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,238
Everyone aged 10 to 60

61
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:39,488
will drill daily with
spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

62
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,697
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

63
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,988
Not just the boys.

64
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,488
We can't defend the North

65
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,655
if only half the population is fighting.

66
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:54,363
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

67
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:58,029
I don't plan on knitting by
the fire while men fight for me.

68
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,113
I might be small, Lord
Glover, and I might be a girl,

69
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,571
but I am every bit as
much a Northerner as you.

70
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,446
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

71
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,572
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

72
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:15,321
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

73
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,405
Aye!

74
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,905
While we're preparing for attack,

75
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,238
we need to shore up our defenses.

76
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,865
The only thing standing between us

77
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,730
and the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

78
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:28,655
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

79
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:31,072
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

80
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:34,947
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

81
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:39,154
You want us to man the castles for you?

82
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,738
Aye.

83
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:43,571
Last time we saw the
Night King was at Hardhome.

84
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:46,905
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

85
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,446
Then that's where I'll go.

86
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,613
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

87
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,488
If they breach the Wall,

88
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,029
the first two castles in their path

89
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,571
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

90
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:03,238
The Umbers and the
Karstarks betrayed the North.

91
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,863
Their castles should be torn down

92
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,613
with not a stone left standing.

93
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:09,196
The castles committed no crimes.

94
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:12,613
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

95
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,947
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

96
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:18,488
loyal families who
supported us against Ramsay.

97
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:21,697
Aye!

98
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,988
The Umbers and the Karstarks

99
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,488
have fought beside the
Starks for centuries.

100
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:29,099
They've kept faith for
generation after generation.

101
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,655
And then they broke faith.

102
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,738
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

103
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,321
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

104
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,988
So there's no punishment for treason

105
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,489
and no reward for loyalty?

106
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:48,321
The punishment for treason is death.

107
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:51,154
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

108
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:53,988
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

109
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:56,405
They died fighting for Ramsay.

110
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:57,988
Give the castles to the families

111
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,363
of the men who died fighting for you.

112
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:16,489
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

113
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,321
I executed men who betrayed me.

114
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,571
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

115
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:26,363
My father always said,

116
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:28,947
"The man who passes the
sentence should swing the sword,"

117
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,238
and I have tried to live by those words.

118
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,697
But I will not punish a
son for his father's sins,

119
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:38,154
and I will not take a family home away

120
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,530
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

121
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,113
That is my decision,

122
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,698
and my decision is final.

123
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:53,906
Ned Umber.

124
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,239
Alys Karstark.

125
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,071
For centuries, our families fought

126
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,905
side by side on the battlefield.

127
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:27,905
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

128
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:30,446
to serve as our bannermen

129
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,155
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

130
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:43,072
Stand.

131
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,571
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

132
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:52,571
The North needs to band together,

133
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,948
all the living north.

134
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,613
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,

135
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:59,863
now and always?

136
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,321
Now and always!

137
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,697
You are my sister, but I am king now.

138
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,321
Will you start wearing a crown?

139
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,947
When you question my decisions

140
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,113
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

141
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:30,724
So I can't question
your decisions anymore?

142
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:31,822
Of course you can, but...

143
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:34,154
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

144
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:36,155
You think he was a good king?

145
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,781
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

146
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:46,321
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

147
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:47,823
Thank you.

148
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,530
You're good at this, you know.

149
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,988
- At what?
- At ruling.

150
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,822
No.

151
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:56,823
You are.

152
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,322
You are.

153
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,113
They respect you, they really do,

154
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,279
but you have to...

155
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,697
Why are you laughing?

156
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,863
What did father used to say?

157
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:12,196
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

158
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:13,697
He never said that to me.

159
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,405
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

160
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,488
Because he was trying to protect us.

161
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,488
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

162
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,196
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

163
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,482
Stop trying.

164
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:27,905
All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

165
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,279
and you stop trying to undermine me.

166
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,489
I'm not trying to undermine you!

167
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,071
You have to be smarter than Father.

168
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,738
You need to be smarter than Robb.

169
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,863
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

170
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,905
and they both lost their heads for it.

171
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:46,113
And how should I be smarter?

172
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,572
By listening to you?

173
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,905
Would that be so terrible?

174
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,864
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

175
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,905
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

176
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,822
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

177
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,446
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms..."

178
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,906
What does she want?

179
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,947
Come to King's Landing.

180
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:20,780
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

181
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,905
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

182
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,738
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

183
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,780
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

184
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,405
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

185
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,113
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

186
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,947
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

187
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,863
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

188
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,655
Winter is here. The
Lannisters are a southern army.

189
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,113
They've never ranged this far north.

190
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:44,446
You're the military man, but I know her.

191
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,780
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

192
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,948
Everyone who's ever crossed
her, she's found a way to murder.

193
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,114
You almost sound as if you admire her.

194
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:01,948
I learned a great deal from her.

195
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,655
What is this?

196
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,321
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

197
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:46,113
It's what Father trained us
for, whether he knew it or not.

198
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,613
He knew it.

199
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:49,571
Made me memorize every damn city, town,

200
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,154
lake, forest, and mountain.

201
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,322
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

202
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,196
You've been quiet since you came home.

203
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,655
Are you angry with me?

204
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:00,906
No, not angry.

205
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,030
Are you afraid of me?

206
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,155
Should I be?

207
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:13,863
Daenerys Targaryen has
chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

208
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,655
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

209
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,655
hoping to take back her father's throne.

210
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:22,071
Our little brother,

211
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:24,238
the one you love so much,

212
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,071
the one you set free,

213
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,363
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

214
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:32,698
now he stands beside our
enemies and gives them counsel.

215
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,405
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

216
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,114
Where will they land?

217
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,238
Dragonstone.

218
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,029
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

219
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,029
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

220
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,488
and that's where she was born.

221
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,780
Enemies to the east.

222
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,571
Enemies to the south...

223
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,571
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

224
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,405
Enemies to the west...

225
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,238
Olenna, the old cunt.

226
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,446
Another traitor.

227
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,613
Enemies to the north.

228
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,738
Ned Stark's bastard has
been named King in the North

229
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:14,738
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

230
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,405
Enemies everywhere. We're
surrounded by traitors.

231
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,113
You're in command of
the Lannister army now.

232
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,238
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

233
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,530
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

234
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,697
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

235
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:31,738
Will the Tyrell
bannermen stand alongside

236
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,029
a Dothraki horde and
Unsullied slave soldiers?

237
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,697
If they think Daenerys will win.

238
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,655
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

239
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,781
Right now, we look like the losing side.

240
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,905
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

241
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,655
Three kingdoms, at best.

242
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:51,196
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

243
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,988
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

244
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,029
I understand whoever loses dies.

245
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,321
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

246
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,905
that lasts a thousand years.

247
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,488
A dynasty for whom?

248
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:05,488
Our children are dead.

249
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:06,947
We're the last of us.

250
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:08,989
A dynasty for us, then.

251
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:13,698
We never talked about Tommen.

252
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,655
There's nothing to say.

253
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,613
Our baby boy killed himself.

254
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,154
He betrayed me.

255
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,655
He betrayed us both.

256
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,488
Should we spend our
days mourning the dead...

257
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,905
Mother, father, and all our children?

258
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,488
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

259
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,697
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

260
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,698
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

261
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,196
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

262
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:47,363
Where are our allies now?

263
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:49,571
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

264
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,238
I heard.

265
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,780
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

266
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,780
He was a useless, old coward,

267
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,613
but the Freys supported us.

268
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:58,988
Now they're all dead.

269
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,697
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

270
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,238
We need allies.

271
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,029
Stronger, better allies.

272
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,155
We can't win this war alone.

273
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,781
You think I listened to Father
for 40 years and learned nothing?

274
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,279
The Greyjoys?

275
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,863
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

276
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,697
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

277
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,279
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

278
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,780
the new King of the Iron Islands.

279
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:02,488
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

280
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,613
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

281
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:08,029
How are they different from the Freys?

282
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,613
They both broke their promises

283
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:11,905
and murdered their former
friends as soon as it suited them.

284
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,905
So does everyone when it suits them.

285
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:17,530
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

286
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:20,154
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

287
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,571
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

288
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,144
All they know how to do is steal things

289
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,745
they can't build or grow themselves.

290
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:28,905
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

291
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,947
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

292
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,614
A queen.

293
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,530
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

294
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,905
they turned on me.

295
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:52,154
Their own uncle.

296
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:54,780
They stole my best ships and ran.

297
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,947
Sailed them right across the world

298
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:59,238
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

299
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:02,697
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

300
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:06,154
It's nothing compared to
the treason you suffered

301
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:09,822
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

302
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,531
But still, it bothers me.

303
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:17,196
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

304
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:21,363
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

305
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:23,279
are fighting for the same side,

306
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,822
I thought we rightful monarchs

307
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,406
could murder them together.

308
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:37,197
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

309
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:44,321
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

310
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:48,363
but as I recall, you
were soundly defeated.

311
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:50,196
Come to mention it,

312
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,571
weren't you the one who
started that rebellion

313
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:56,780
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

314
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,488
You certainly caught us there.

315
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:01,321
Very smart move on your part.

316
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:05,571
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

317
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:06,780
I was there.

318
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,613
I remember very well.

319
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,154
I saw you.

320
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,446
I heard so much talk.

321
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:16,071
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

322
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,780
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

323
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:21,071
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

324
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,239
and started cutting people down...

325
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,446
it was glorious.

326
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,863
Like a dance.

327
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:33,071
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

328
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,405
The place was getting crowded.

329
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,988
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

330
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,196
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

331
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,655
A good thing for me.

332
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:46,279
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

333
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,196
If I hadn't done that,

334
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:51,781
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

335
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,656
If not the most humble.

336
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:56,948
You're not humble.

337
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,906
You're the queen of a great nation.

338
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:03,863
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

339
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:08,530
They're nothing but
rocks and bird shit and...

340
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:11,405
And a lot of very unattractive people.

341
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,029
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

342
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,154
that's something else entirely.

343
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:20,446
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

344
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:25,029
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

345
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,863
You can defeat the invaders of the east

346
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:30,822
and the pretenders of
the north and south.

347
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,447
What do you want in return?

348
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:37,571
Ever since I was a little boy,

349
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:39,488
I wanted to grow up and marry

350
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,613
the most beautiful woman in the world.

351
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,321
So here I am,

352
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,780
with a thousand ships

353
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,322
and two good hands.

354
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,322
I decline your proposal.

355
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:58,863
Why?

356
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,531
You're not trustworthy.

357
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:04,029
You've broken promises to allies before

358
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,488
and murdered them at
the nearest opportunity.

359
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,030
You murdered your own brother.

360
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:11,697
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

361
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,363
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

362
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,738
You need proof of my honest intentions.

363
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,196
In my experience,

364
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:22,196
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

365
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,488
A priceless gift.

366
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:26,363
I won't return to King's Landing

367
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:28,406
until I have that for you.

368
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,238
Ah, Maester Weyland.

369
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:40,739
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

370
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:42,989
Weigh that.

371
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:47,446
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

372
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:49,363
Mankind's curse.

373
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,446
Archmaester, I was wondering...

374
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,405
What's the weight?

375
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,364
Um, 147.

376
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,363
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

377
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:06,446
I don't remember your proposition.

378
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,738
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

379
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,905
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

380
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,613
That area is reserved for maesters.

381
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:17,113
- Are you a maester?
- No.

382
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:19,239
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

383
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:31,196
Archmaester, with respect,

384
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,029
I've seen them...

385
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,279
The Army of the Dead.

386
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,655
The white walkers.

387
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:40,154
I was sent here to
learn how to defeat them,

388
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,697
but everyone in the Citadel,

389
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:44,863
those who will even talk to me,

390
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,697
they all doubt the walkers
ever existed in the first place.

391
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,238
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

392
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,322
It's their job.

393
00:30:56,864 --> 00:31:00,155
But the tales of the Long
Night can't be pure fabrication.

394
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:04,905
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

395
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,488
Sources in the restricted area?

396
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,114
The very same.

397
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:11,863
And the simplest explanation

398
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,822
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

399
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,321
is that you're telling the truth

400
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,446
and that you saw what you say you saw.

401
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,322
So, you believe me.

402
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:25,154
I do.

403
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,864
You'll finish weighing that heart?

404
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,989
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

405
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,863
We're not like the
people south of the Twins.

406
00:31:37,864 --> 00:31:40,072
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

407
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:46,322
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

408
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,988
We are this world's
memory, Samwell Tarly.

409
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:53,947
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

410
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,113
Don't remember any meal but the last,

411
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,780
can't see forward to any but the next.

412
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,947
And every time you leave
the house and shut the door,

413
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:03,863
they howl like you're gone forever.

414
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:06,863
When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

415
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,697
people thought the end was near.

416
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:11,780
The end of the Targaryen
dynasty. "How will we survive?"

417
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:15,238
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

418
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,196
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

419
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:19,238
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

420
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:22,113
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

421
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,238
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

422
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,948
But it wasn't. None of it was.

423
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,280
The Wall has stood through it all.

424
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:35,531
And every winter that
ever came has ended.

425
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:45,906
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

426
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,406
Nope.

427
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:49,531
Nope.

428
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:03,989
You're a lucky man.

429
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,322
I've heard she beat the
Hound in single combat.

430
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,614
She's a very impressive woman.

431
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,155
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

432
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,530
I want you to be happy.

433
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,905
I want you to be safe.

434
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:30,196
I am safe.

435
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,363
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

436
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,739
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

437
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:42,406
What about happy?

438
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,905
Why aren't you happy?

439
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:48,863
What do you want that you do not have?

440
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:51,613
At the moment, peace and quiet.

441
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,905
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

442
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,280
I'll assume it was something clever.

443
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:06,113
My lady.

444
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:07,906
My lady.

445
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:19,947
Why is he still here?

446
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:22,697
We need his men.

447
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:26,280
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

448
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,280
Littlefinger saved us.

449
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:35,072
He wants something.

450
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:39,197
I know exactly what he wants.

451
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:47,947
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

452
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:50,988
♪ Down from his hill on high ♪

453
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:54,571
♪ O'er the winds and the
steps and the cobbles ♪

454
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:58,071
♪ He rode to a woman's sigh ♪

455
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,279
♪ For she was his secret treasure ♪

456
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,697
♪ She was his shame and his bliss ♪

457
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:07,613
♪ And a chain and
a keep are nothing ♪

458
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:10,279
♪ Compared to a woman's kiss ♪

459
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,780
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

460
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,446
♪ But a woman's hands are warm ♪

461
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:20,279
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

462
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,280
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

463
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:26,029
That's a pretty song.

464
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,113
I've never heard it before.

465
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:28,571
It's a new one.

466
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:31,571
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

467
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,029
I don't want to steal your food.

468
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,405
You're not stealing, we're offering.

469
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:37,781
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

470
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,780
You heading south?

471
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:09,863
King's Landing.

472
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:11,947
Poor girl.

473
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:14,613
Not so bad, is it?

474
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:16,738
Depends on your taste, I guess.

475
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:19,160
If you like your streets
covered in shit and pig's blood,

476
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,738
it's the town for you.

477
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,863
All my life, I wanted
to see the Red Keep,

478
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,029
the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

479
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,988
Then when I finally make it,

480
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,196
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

481
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:31,154
the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell,

482
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,113
and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

483
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:34,988
The people who live there,

484
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,697
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

485
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:39,822
Worst place in the world.

486
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:42,196
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

487
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:44,780
There's been some trouble
with the Freys up at the Twins,

488
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:48,114
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

489
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:54,029
Here you go. Guests first.

490
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,154
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

491
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,613
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

492
00:37:58,614 --> 00:38:00,572
Strangers will be kind to you.

493
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:15,154
You're a long way from home.

494
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:17,238
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

495
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,071
Yeah, endless adventures.

496
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,072
They'll be singing about
us for a thousand years.

497
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:26,405
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

498
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,738
But now we've been gone a
while, we can't wait to get home.

499
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,780
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

500
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:34,155
I ought to be out there with him.

501
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,113
My wife just had our first baby.

502
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:40,405
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

503
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:42,571
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

504
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:49,029
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

505
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,988
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

506
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:53,989
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

507
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,572
Are you old enough to drink?

508
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,905
It's blackberry wine.

509
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:17,197
I made it myself.

510
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,781
It's really good.

511
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:25,280
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

512
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,823
I'm going to kill the queen.

513
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,196
Bad night to be outdoors.

514
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:01,029
You've got real powerful
magic to figure that out.

515
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,113
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

516
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:08,279
"It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

517
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,238
It's gonna be a cold night."

518
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,113
You're a grouchy old
bear, aren't you, Clegane?

519
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:16,780
You want some rum?

520
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,863
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

521
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,906
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

522
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:26,197
Experience.

523
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:32,656
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

524
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:37,738
These people don't want us here.

525
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,655
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

526
00:40:40,656 --> 00:40:42,614
No smoke coming from the chimney.

527
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,571
I don't like the look of it.

528
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:06,571
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

529
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:09,196
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...

530
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:11,196
Bald cocksuckers like you.

531
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:14,071
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

532
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,864
Bald cunt.

533
00:41:17,948 --> 00:41:19,488
Come on.

534
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:21,322
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

535
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,446
They don't.

536
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,029
See if there's a larder.

537
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,739
They always leave something behind.

538
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:13,766
How do you think it ended for them?

539
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,530
With death.

540
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:19,488
Girl died in her father's arms.

541
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:22,322
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

542
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:26,446
I'd say they were starving.

543
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,363
And rather than let
his little girl suffer,

544
00:42:28,364 --> 00:42:30,321
he ended it for both of them.

545
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:32,571
Doesn't matter now.

546
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:35,364
No, doesn't matter now.

547
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:51,530
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

548
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:53,029
Aye.

549
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,113
I think the first time we
met was at that tournament...

550
00:42:57,114 --> 00:43:00,363
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

551
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:03,446
You're not bad.

552
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,822
I don't hate you.

553
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:07,196
Don't like you, but you're not bad.

554
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:09,029
Thank you, Clegane.

555
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,363
That warms the heart.

556
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:13,029
But there's nothing special about you.

557
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,863
You're right about that.

558
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:18,322
So why does the Lord of
Light keep bringing you back?

559
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:21,697
I've met better men than you,

560
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:26,613
and they've been hanged
from crossbeams, or beheaded,

561
00:43:26,614 --> 00:43:31,488
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

562
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,571
None of them came back.

563
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:36,154
So, why you?

564
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,071
You think I don't ask myself that?

565
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:42,238
Every hour of every day?

566
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,906
Why am I here?

567
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,071
What am I supposed to do?

568
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:48,864
What does the Lord see in me?

569
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,197
And?

570
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:56,571
I don't know.

571
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,571
I don't understand our Lord.

572
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,405
Your Lord.

573
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:02,196
I don't know what He wants from me.

574
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:06,697
I only know that He wants me alive.

575
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:09,465
If he's so all-powerful,
why doesn't he just tell you

576
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:10,786
what the fuck he wants?

577
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:14,863
Clegane.

578
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:16,239
Come over here.

579
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,614
Don't worry. The fire won't bite.

580
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:24,905
I want to show you something.

581
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:28,114
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

582
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,613
Aye.

583
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:32,947
Almost seems like divine justice.

584
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:35,488
There's no divine
justice, you dumb cunt.

585
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:38,613
If there was, you'd be dead...

586
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,781
and that girl would be alive.

587
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:49,988
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

588
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:52,113
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

589
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:55,656
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

590
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,530
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

591
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,988
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

592
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:04,488
We can't tell you.

593
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:06,656
Only the fire can tell you.

594
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,698
What do you see?

595
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:23,905
Logs burning.

596
00:45:23,906 --> 00:45:25,989
Keep looking.

597
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:32,864
What do you see?

598
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,071
Ice.

599
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:46,989
A wall of ice.

600
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:50,406
The Wall.

601
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:54,446
What else?

602
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:58,656
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

603
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:02,072
There's a castle there.

604
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:10,988
There's a mountain.

605
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:14,447
Looks like an arrowhead.

606
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:19,239
The dead are marching past.

607
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:26,030
Thousands of them.

608
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:33,572
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

609
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:37,197
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

610
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,447
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

611
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,447
Burying the dead.

612
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:30,655
You knew these people.

613
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:32,155
Not really.

614
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:36,488
We ask the Father to
judge us with mercy.

615
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,531
We ask the Mother to...

616
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,531
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

617
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:54,029
I'm sorry you're dead.

618
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,947
You deserved better.

619
00:48:56,948 --> 00:48:57,948
Both of you.

620
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,571
Hey.

621
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,154
Mom.

622
00:49:30,155 --> 00:49:31,906
You should really sleep, Sam.

623
00:49:33,364 --> 00:49:34,906
The dead don't.

624
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,280
"Legends of the Long Night."

625
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,279
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

626
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,823
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

627
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,114
What is it?

628
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:16,863
It's a map of Dragonstone.

629
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,154
The Targaryens built their
first stronghold there

630
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:20,948
when they invaded Westeros.

631
00:50:23,656 --> 00:50:25,405
That's dragonglass?

632
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:27,154
A mountain of it.

633
00:50:27,155 --> 00:50:28,321
Beneath the ground.

634
00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:30,655
Stannis told me, but I didn't think...

635
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:34,155
This is important. Jon needs to know.

636
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,530
Has she come yet?

637
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:31,154
Who?

638
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,363
The Dragon Queen.

639
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:35,322
Daenerys Stormborn.

640
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,239
Haven't heard anything.

641
00:57:18,322 --> 00:57:19,484
Shall we begin?

642
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:30,401
