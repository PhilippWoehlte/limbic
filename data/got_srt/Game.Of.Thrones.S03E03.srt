1
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,245
<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

2
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,847
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

3
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,083
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing--

4
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,419
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

5
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:18,288
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

6
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,756
Robb knows
I meant him no disr--

7
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,293
You're lucky
I'm not your king.

8
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,492
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around

9
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:27,031
like a victory flag.

10
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:29,667
My blunder sent
Tywin's mad dog

11
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,837
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

12
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,007
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

13
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,675
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

14
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,190
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

15
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,079
It's not about glory.

16
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,517
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

17
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,985
I seized an opportunity.

18
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,920
What value was the mill?

19
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,155
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

20
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,523
<i>Is he there now?</i>

21
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,759
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

22
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,026
He could not withstand us.

23
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,262
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

24
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:02,500
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

25
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,636
I wanted him to chase us,

26
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,139
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

27
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,374
without a strategic thought
in his head.

28
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,411
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

29
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,283
Instead, I have a mill.

30
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,687
<i>We took hostages.</i>

31
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,424
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

32
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,961
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

33
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,430
Martyn is 15,
I believe.

34
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,839
Tywin Lannister
has my sisters.

35
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,807
Have I sued for peace?

36
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,342
No.

37
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,777
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

38
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,914
because we have
his father's

39
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,816
brother's
great-grandsons?

40
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,989
No.

41
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,024
How many men
did you lose?

42
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,760
208.

43
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,062
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

44
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,032
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

45
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,174
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,577
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

47
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,847
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

48
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,183
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

49
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,652
You know who isn't?

50
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,922
Tywin Lannister.

51
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:23,373
Intimate.
Lovely table.

52
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:26,209
<i>Better chairs than the old</i>
<i>small council chamber.</i>

53
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,679
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

54
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:32,549
What news of Jaime?

55
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,821
20,000 unwashed
Northerners

56
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,890
have known about
his escape for weeks.

57
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,292
<i>Collectively, you control</i>
<i>more spies and informants</i>

58
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,227
than the rest
of the world combined.

59
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:47,163
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

60
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,299
has any notion
of where he is?

61
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,302
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

62
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,573
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

63
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:59,477
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

64
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:03,280
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

65
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:08,418
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

66
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:12,021
which would seem to make
him Lord of Harrenhal,

67
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:14,175
- in practice if not in name.
- <i>Well, let him have it.</i>

68
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,057
The name suits
our purposes

69
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,094
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

70
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:22,230
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

71
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:25,200
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

72
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,836
<i>Lady Arryn and I have known</i>
<i>each other since we were children.</i>

73
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,338
She has always been...

74
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,907
positively predisposed
toward me.

75
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:36,244
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

76
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,079
acting Lord of the Vale.

77
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,949
Titles do seem
to breed titles.

78
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,151
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

79
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,953
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

80
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,989
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

81
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,858
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

82
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:52,695
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

83
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:57,266
<i>but Lord Baelish's absence</i>
<i>would present certain problems.</i>

84
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,201
The royal wedding
may end up

85
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:02,104
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

86
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,274
<i>Summer has ended,</i>
<i>hard days lie ahead.</i>

87
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:09,145
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

88
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,347
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

89
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,484
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

90
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,419
Master of Coin?

91
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:19,088
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

92
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:21,057
I'm quite good
at spending money,

93
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,059
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

94
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,795
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

95
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,465
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

96
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,200
Hear, hear.

97
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,471
<i>He lifted her</i>
<i>high in the air</i>

98
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,706
<i>He sniffed and roared
and smelled her there<i>

99
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,075
<i>She kicked and wailed,
a maid so fair<i>

100
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,677
<i>But he licked the honey
from her hair<i>

101
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:43,447
<i>From there to here,
from here to there<i>

102
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:45,582
<i>All black and brown
and covered with hair<i>

103
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,751
<i>He smelled that girl
in the summer air<i>

104
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,954
<i>The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair...<i>

105
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,990
I hope you're pleased.

106
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:56,492
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

107
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,494
You were armed
when we were taken.

108
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,196
I was in chains
if you recall.

109
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,131
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

110
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,099
if my hands
weren't bound.

111
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:07,436
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

112
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,139
what a brilliant swordsman."

113
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,474
You were slower
than I expected.

114
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,243
And more predictable.

115
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,844
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

116
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,680
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

117
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:19,649
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

118
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:22,118
You were not beating me.

119
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:24,320
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

120
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,422
once.

121
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,525
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

122
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,999
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

123
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,567
More than once.

124
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:40,771
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

125
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,675
You'd be wise
not to resist.

126
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,777
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

127
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:48,278
You think I care
about my teeth?

128
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:51,548
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

129
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,553
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

130
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:58,288
Do you understand?

131
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:01,058
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

132
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,393
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

133
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,629
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

134
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,464
Pretend they're Renly.

135
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,501
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

136
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,836
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

137
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,873
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

138
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,275
But I'm not,
thank the gods.

139
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,915
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

140
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,850
Doesn't have
to look pretty.

141
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,286
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

142
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,455
Why are you
helping him?

143
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,690
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

144
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,326
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

145
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,495
- What am I?
- Our guest.

146
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,597
No one's put
any chains on you.

147
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,366
So I can
walk away, then?

148
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,202
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

149
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,504
You're lucky we found you.

150
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:54,978
You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

151
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:56,579
Better than anyone
you've ever met.

152
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:58,547
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

153
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,716
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

154
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,187
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

155
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:06,557
Why?
So you can kiss him?

156
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:08,692
You remember the last time
you were here?

157
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:12,263
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

158
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,899
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

159
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:17,135
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

160
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:23,541
Watch your head.

161
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,976
Off we go.

162
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,313
<i>Walk up!</i>

163
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:34,418
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

164
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:35,919
I'm staying.

165
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:40,491
You're what?

166
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:42,793
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

167
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,662
and she said
she never had better.

168
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,564
Told Thoros she's keeping me
as a payment

169
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:48,066
for all the free meals
she's given him.

170
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,268
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

171
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,737
My brother ain't no king.

172
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:54,405
I'm not a Stark
of Winterhell.

173
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,840
Winterfell.

174
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:59,343
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

175
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:04,515
Well, I made you
something.

176
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,822
What is it?

177
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,091
It's a wolf.

178
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,163
Yes, it is.

179
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:21,799
That's the tail?

180
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,334
Yeah.

181
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,705
Well, be safe.

182
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,574
Yeah, you, too.

183
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,309
Don't get stabbed.

184
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:34,245
You don't...

185
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,114
burn your fingers.

186
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,593
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

187
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,895
Good-bye, Arry.

188
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,810
Up you go, little lady.

189
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,518
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

190
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,821
It's really good.

191
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:25,463
A person could
almost be forgiven

192
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:27,698
for forgetting
we're at war.

193
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:34,538
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

194
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,407
in most places
in the world

195
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:40,710
absolutely nothing
is happening.

196
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:45,082
I've missed you, Uncle.

197
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,084
Father missed you, too,

198
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,019
from the day you left.

199
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,221
Maybe he never said it
in so many words--

200
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,857
Maybe?

201
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,159
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

202
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,961
I was surprised
when he died.

203
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,764
Didn't think death
had the patience.

204
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:04,703
I'm glad
you were with him.

205
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,604
I wish to the gods
I had been.

206
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,010
Did you make peace
in the end?

207
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,846
After 30 years of fighting,

208
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,282
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

209
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:21,052
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

210
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,254
He said it was
an old joke

211
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,790
and it was never funny
to begin with.

212
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,828
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

213
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:32,731
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

214
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:39,071
Every time he would leave
for the capital

215
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:41,840
or fight in a campaign,

216
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:44,008
I'd see him off.

217
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:47,144
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

218
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,347
"Wait for me

219
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:53,851
and I'll come back
to you."

220
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,420
And I would sit
at this window

221
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:59,190
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

222
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,362
I wonder

223
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:08,131
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

224
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,100
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

225
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:12,302
waiting for me
to return.

226
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:15,805
<i>I will never</i>
<i>see them again.</i>

227
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,977
You mustn't think it.

228
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,312
We don't know the truth.

229
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:26,015
They could be in hiding.

230
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:31,822
Robb believes
they're alive.

231
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,991
And he must go on
believing.

232
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,794
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

233
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:40,898
And you must remain
strong for him.

234
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,677
You're Robb Stark's wife.

235
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,180
Hold still.

236
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,450
Is it true
what they say about him?

237
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:03,053
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

238
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,356
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

239
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,092
True.

240
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,361
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

241
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,363
True.

242
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,334
You're a Lannister,
aren't you?

243
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:18,568
Martyn Lannister.

244
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:21,738
Martyn Lannister.

245
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,039
You've nothing to fear.

246
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,208
My husband
doesn't eat children.

247
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:29,312
Unless it's a full moon.

248
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:32,148
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

249
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,950
See?

250
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:36,220
Nothing to fear.

251
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,741
Always the artists.

252
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,599
It's only horses.

253
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,233
No men.

254
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,971
You said
there was dead crows.

255
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,340
There was.

256
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,144
How many men were here?

257
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,380
About 300.

258
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,815
And you know
what those men are now?

259
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:41,889
We're all the same to them--
meat for their army.

260
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,826
Do you think
anyone got away?

261
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,361
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

262
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,763
<i>You don't go far</i>
<i>betting against Mormont.</i>

263
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:52,099
But dead or alive,

264
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,268
he took a big gamble
coming north.

265
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,369
<i>And he lost.</i>

266
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,738
His best fighting men
are dead.

267
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,975
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

268
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,977
or a blue-eyed corpse,

269
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,813
he's a long way
from home.

270
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,215
Tormund.

271
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,251
Climb the Wall.

272
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:14,354
Take Orell
and 20 good men.

273
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,989
And take this one.

274
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:18,858
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

275
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:21,294
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

276
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,730
throw him off the Wall.

277
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,666
See if crows can fly.

278
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,003
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

279
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,605
Hide near Castle Black.

280
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,940
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

281
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:36,676
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

282
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,545
but it only guards
one side.

283
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:41,748
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

284
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,950
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

285
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,153
How will we see
your signal?

286
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,889
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

287
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,692
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

288
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,928
the North has ever seen.

289
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,759
Ghost?

290
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:39,708
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

291
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:41,744
We've come a long way.

292
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:46,516
<i>Smaller flock</i>
<i>than you went north with.</i>

293
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,652
We can talk inside.

294
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,788
Oh, can we?

295
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:14,377
<i>They need some water.</i>

296
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:16,580
<i>Tether it</i>
<i>and I'll be inside.</i>

297
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,363
<i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

298
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:36,932
They're not for you.

299
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:39,434
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

300
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:42,905
Aye, pig's got
value to me.

301
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:46,808
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

302
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:50,980
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

303
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:53,348
You are a godly man?

304
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:56,819
I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.

305
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,854
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

306
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:03,025
<i>your swords and cloaks</i>
<i>and bloody fires won't help you.</i>

307
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,296
The only ones left will be
those who are right with the gods.

308
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,897
The real gods.

309
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,172
Go tell her she can
bite down on a rag

310
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,875
or she can bite down
on my fist.

311
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:26,382
Women.

312
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,284
That sow right there
gave birth

313
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,619
<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

314
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,788
Barely a grunt.

315
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:37,159
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

316
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,762
Now why don't
you dine on him?

317
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:42,431
Carve off what you need
as you go.

318
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:45,600
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

319
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:05,086
<i>Here we are.</i>

320
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,489
<i>Sharpen these for me,</i>
<i>would ya?</i>

321
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,076
<i>I see the head.</i>
<i>Push.</i>

322
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,878
That's it.

323
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:32,248
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

324
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,654
One more push
should do it.

325
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,968
What is it?
What is it?

326
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,935
Keep quiet.

327
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:57,002
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

328
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:59,071
I can ride.

329
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,374
You're sure?

330
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,156
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

331
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,592
<i>Your sister's</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

332
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:22,327
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

333
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:23,522
We're not in
the Iron Islands.

334
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,098
- Go.
- Come on.

335
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,733
Come on.
Come on.

336
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,701
Come on. Come on.

337
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:35,574
<i>Come on back.</i>

338
00:26:39,312 --> 00:26:41,479
<i>You refuse to tell me</i>
<i>where you're going?</i>

339
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,615
<i>I don't know yet.</i>
<i>The fires will show me.</i>

340
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,384
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

341
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,087
You're abandoning me.

342
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,289
I will never abandon you.

343
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:56,260
You are the Son of Fire.

344
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,829
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

345
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:01,031
When I return,
you will understand.

346
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,636
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

347
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,707
They're laughing at me

348
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,244
the way Renly
laughed at me.

349
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,846
I want Joffrey dead.

350
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,383
I want Robb Stark dead.

351
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:23,988
Make me another son.

352
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,623
I cannot.

353
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:26,858
Why?

354
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:29,928
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

355
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,831
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

356
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:40,005
I want you.

357
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,591
Your fires burn low,
my king.

358
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:03,531
There is another way.
A better way.

359
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:06,133
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

360
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,768
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

361
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,369
You are.

362
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,638
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

363
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,844
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

364
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,013
but first there must
be sacrifices.

365
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,849
The Lord of Light
demands it.

366
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,796
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

367
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,932
- To whom?
- To any slave who contemplates doing

368
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,634
whatever these slaves did.

369
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:44,170
Give me your water.

370
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:47,907
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

371
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:56,182
Here, drink.

372
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,753
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

373
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:02,355
Leave tonight,
I beg you.

374
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:03,890
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

375
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,393
<i>We can find sellswords</i>
<i>in Pentos and Myr.</i>

376
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:10,897
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

377
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:14,734
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

378
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,970
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

379
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:20,206
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

380
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,745
How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

381
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:28,013
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

382
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,416
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

383
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:38,124
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

384
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:41,293
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

385
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,696
Babies, children,
old men.

386
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:46,132
More women raped
than you can count.

387
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,766
There's a beast
in every man

388
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,770
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

389
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,172
But the Unsullied
are not men.

390
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:54,840
They do not rape.

391
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,944
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

392
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:02,648
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

393
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,149
Do you disagree,
Ser Barristan?

394
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:07,253
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

395
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,922
men died for him
because they believed in him,

396
00:30:09,956 --> 00:30:11,657
because they loved him,

397
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:14,160
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

398
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:18,731
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

399
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,569
I bled beside him.

400
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:26,139
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

401
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,008
and Rhaegar died.

402
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,579
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

403
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:36,150
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

404
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,386
I wish I had known him.

405
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,454
But he was not
the last dragon.

406
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:52,446
All?

407
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:55,067
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

408
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,840
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

409
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:16,125
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

410
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,893
Is this what you mean
by all?

411
00:31:17,927 --> 00:31:19,828
Yes. 8,000.

412
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,164
<i>And the ones</i>
<i>still in training as well.</i>

413
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:34,944
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

414
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,279
<i>If they fail</i>
<i>on the battlefield,</i>

415
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,548
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

416
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:41,450
I will have them all
or take none.

417
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,675
Many will fall in battle.

418
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,752
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

419
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:53,061
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

420
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,735
Your ship will buy you
100 Unsullied.

421
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:04,607
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

422
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:09,045
<i>The gold you have left</i>
<i>is worth 10.</i>

423
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:12,848
But good Master Kraznys
will give you 20.

424
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:17,419
The Dothraki
you have with you--

425
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:25,561
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

426
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:28,130
<i>but Master Kraznys will give</i>
<i>you three Unsullied</i>

427
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:29,732
<i>for all of them.</i>

428
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,869
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay

429
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:39,509
for the remaining
7,877 Unsullied.

430
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,450
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

431
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:54,224
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

432
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,959
Khaleesi, please.

433
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,603
Three dragons.

434
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:08,905
- One.
- Two.

435
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,273
One.

436
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:23,018
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

437
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,487
- Done.
- Done.

438
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,861
I'll take you
as well, now.

439
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:35,831
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

440
00:33:35,865 --> 00:33:38,000
A token of a bargain
well struck.

441
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,846
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth
more than any army.

442
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:54,149
Aegon Targaryen
proved that.

443
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:57,752
You're both here
to advise me.

444
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,773
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me

445
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:01,323
in front of strangers again,

446
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:03,858
you'll be advising
someone else.

447
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:06,194
Is that understood?

448
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,665
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

449
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,334
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

450
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,570
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

451
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:17,605
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

452
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,942
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

453
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,112
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

454
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,714
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

455
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:30,118
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

456
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,873
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

457
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:36,157
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

458
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:39,060
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

459
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:41,729
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

460
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:44,899
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

461
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,468
All questions have been
taken from them.

462
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,369
They obey, that is all.

463
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:52,172
<i>Once they are yours,</i>
<i>they are yours.</i>

464
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,273
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

465
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:57,777
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

466
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:01,947
<i>You may go hungry.</i>
<i>You may fall sick.</i>

467
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:04,116
You may be killed.

468
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,852
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

469
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:09,455
Yes, all men
must die.

470
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:12,625
But we are not men.

471
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,105
<i>A surprising place to keep</i>
<i>the royal ledgers.</i>

472
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,241
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

473
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,279
This is the safest place
in the city.

474
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,215
Not for bastards.

475
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,551
That's all of them,
my lord.

476
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,688
<i>Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>Pod.</i>

477
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:43,891
Pod.
Take them outside.

478
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,627
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

479
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,675
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

480
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,510
Only my life.

481
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,478
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

482
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:06,547
You should
have him knighted.

483
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,750
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

484
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:12,853
If only.

485
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,991
I owe you
a significant debt.

486
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:19,393
Our redheaded friend.

487
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,195
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

488
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:24,197
Oh, that.

489
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,400
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

490
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:29,202
Apparently,
Her Grace believed

491
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:33,273
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

492
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,243
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

493
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,311
- I know.
- But we don't.

494
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:39,980
I know.

495
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,715
But how would the queen
get that idea?

496
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,518
Why don't you ask her?

497
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:49,990
Any advice for me
on my new position?

498
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:52,960
Keep a low profile.

499
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:56,263
If I had a gold dragon

500
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,366
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

501
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,268
Well, you are
richer than I am.

502
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,337
Good point.

503
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:06,707
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

504
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:10,211
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

505
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,780
Trivial even.

506
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,582
You want a real challenge?

507
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:15,017
Try whores.

508
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,620
I've tried quite a few.

509
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,122
Well, lots of work to do.

510
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,892
Enjoy the Eyrie.

511
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:24,927
Come on,
I'm here later.

512
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:26,796
Come on.

513
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:31,868
Tonight, then.

514
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:35,905
Looks like dull reading.

515
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:38,207
You think all reading
is dull reading.

516
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:41,110
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

517
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:43,744
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

518
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:46,383
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

519
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,984
to hide what
he's really up to.

520
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:50,053
Unless he made it
all up, yes.

521
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:52,489
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

522
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,791
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

523
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:58,195
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

524
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:00,130
I finally found
a suitable reward

525
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:02,466
for the services you've
provided over and above

526
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:04,068
<i>what might be</i>
<i>considered reasonable.</i>

527
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:06,504
Tell me, Pod,

528
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:09,307
have you ever been
with a woman?

529
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:11,876
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

530
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:17,315
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

531
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:20,084
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

532
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,086
Uh, my lord...

533
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:24,556
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

534
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,791
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

535
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:31,697
Now, as it happens,

536
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:34,233
Marei...

537
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:37,536
is quite the spear
handler herself.

538
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:41,107
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

539
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:43,877
as the battle raged
all around me.

540
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:45,746
He's handsome.

541
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,083
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

542
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:54,022
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

543
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:56,291
in certain circles.

544
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:58,927
<i>One of four women</i>
<i>in the world</i>

545
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,698
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

546
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:05,801
My lord, I don't even...

547
00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:07,570
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

548
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:10,339
<i>for being a thoroughly</i>
<i>respectful fellow</i>

549
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:13,176
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

550
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:18,381
Be back in time
for my supper.

551
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,587
Pace yourself, lad.

552
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:28,056
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

553
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,459
is a magician.

554
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,462
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

555
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,131
and, poof,
mountains of gold.

556
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,567
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

557
00:39:38,602 --> 00:39:40,536
No.

558
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,974
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

559
00:39:45,942 --> 00:39:47,610
What's wrong with that?

560
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:51,313
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

561
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,682
The crown owes millions
to my father.

562
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:56,051
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

563
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:58,053
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

564
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:00,388
Forgive a debt, my father?

565
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,857
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

566
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:04,826
I've never borrowed
money before.

567
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,228
I'm not clear on the rules.

568
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,697
Well...

569
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,932
<i>Ahem!</i>

570
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,270
The basic principle is

571
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:16,805
I lend you money,

572
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,375
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

573
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:22,011
you return it
with interest.

574
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,512
And what if I don't?

575
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,614
Well, you have to.

576
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:26,981
But what if I don't?

577
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:29,350
This is why
I don't lend you money.

578
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,887
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

579
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:34,889
It's the Iron Bank
of Braavos.

580
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:36,624
We owe them
tens of millions.

581
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:41,161
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

582
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:44,331
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

583
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:48,903
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

584
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:51,406
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

585
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,074
The lad's
practically skipping.

586
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:54,776
You were gone
a long time.

587
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,611
I trust you got
your money's worth.

588
00:40:56,646 --> 00:40:58,279
Or should I say
my money's worth?

589
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:03,050
Oh, it was a gift,
Podrick.

590
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,819
This is more than
I give you in a year.

591
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:07,822
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

592
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,357
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

593
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,292
They wouldn't
take it, my lord.

594
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:15,795
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

595
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,197
<i>with the new</i>
<i>Master of Coin.</i>

596
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:19,332
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

597
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:21,901
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

598
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:23,636
What did you tell them?

599
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,237
I didn't tell them
anything.

600
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:28,341
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

601
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,309
And they seemed
to like these things?

602
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,878
Yes, my lord.

603
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:33,613
<i>Of course</i>
<i>they seemed to like it.</i>

604
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,148
They're paid
to seem to like it.

605
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,417
Only they weren't paid.

606
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,387
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

607
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:43,022
they gave him
the time for free?

608
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:44,424
Is that what
you're telling us?

609
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,263
Sit down, Podrick.

610
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:59,304
We're going
to need details.

611
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,741
Copious details.

612
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:45,017
Come on!
Come on!

613
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,521
Come on!

614
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:50,590
Come on.

615
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,594
Ha! Ha!

616
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:19,081
You know how we deal
with runaways here, do you?

617
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:27,991
Take off his pants.

618
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:30,428
No! No!

619
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,096
No, no, no!

620
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,231
I'm gonna fuck you
into the dirt.

621
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:36,767
No, please!
No, no, no!

622
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,368
No, don't!

623
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,672
<i>No, please!</i>

624
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:45,308
<i>No! No!</i>

625
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:16,808
You little bastard.

626
00:45:26,651 --> 00:45:28,686
Come, my lord.

627
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:34,692
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

628
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,819
I'll take
the big bitch first.

629
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:06,222
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

630
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:08,724
<i>My lord, I am</i>
<i>Brienne of Tarth.</i>

631
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:11,093
Lady Catelyn Stark
commanded me

632
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,796
to deliver Ser Jaime
to King's Landing.

633
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,764
Catelyn Stark's
a treasonous cunt.

634
00:46:15,798 --> 00:46:17,766
<i>Orders were to take</i>
<i>the Kingslayer alive.</i>

635
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,968
Nobody said shit about you.

636
00:46:24,974 --> 00:46:27,075
You're only
making it worse.

637
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:33,849
<i>Take her over there</i>
<i>where it's dark.</i>

638
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:35,284
I'd like a little privacy.

639
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:39,321
Come on!

640
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,168
You know who she is,
don't you?

641
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,108
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

642
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:02,245
Never been with
a woman that big.

643
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,048
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

644
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,785
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

645
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:09,420
Heard of Tarth?

646
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:12,289
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

647
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:15,325
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

648
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,362
Every sapphire
in Westeros

649
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:19,930
was mined on Tarth.

650
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:23,434
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

651
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:26,770
- <i>The blue ones.</i>
- I know what they are.

652
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:30,541
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

653
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:33,277
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

654
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,547
<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

655
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,483
her honor unbesmirched.

656
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:51,928
Bring her back here.

657
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:53,363
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

658
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:55,899
- <i>Get up.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

659
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:58,569
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

660
00:47:59,804 --> 00:48:02,005
<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

661
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,742
Not defiled.

662
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:08,544
Fancy word
for a fancy man.

663
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:12,281
I hated to read
as a child,

664
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:15,117
<i>but my father forced me</i>
<i>to study the books every morning</i>

665
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:18,321
<i>before I could practice</i>
<i>with sword or horse.</i>

666
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:21,724
2 hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

667
00:48:21,758 --> 00:48:25,194
I learned a lot
of fancy words.

668
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:27,430
I bet you did.

669
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,607
Your father,

670
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:40,510
he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

671
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:44,948
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

672
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:46,850
<i>And your sons</i>
<i>will be rich men</i>

673
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,218
<i>and their sons</i>
<i>after them.</i>

674
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:51,555
Lands, titles--

675
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:53,857
you'll have them all.

676
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:58,662
The North
can't win this war.

677
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:01,264
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

678
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:02,999
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

679
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:05,102
Aye, you have both.

680
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:09,573
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

681
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:11,442
is admirable.

682
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:14,145
Fighting for
a winning cause

683
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:16,680
is far more rewarding.

684
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:19,116
Hard to argue with that.

685
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:25,357
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

686
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:29,595
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

687
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:32,031
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

688
00:49:32,065 --> 00:49:35,868
but if I could sleep
lying down,

689
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:37,704
my back would
thank you for it.

690
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:39,773
I'm not as young

691
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:42,475
and resilient
as I was once.

692
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,511
None of us are.

693
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,016
<i>Unchain Ser Jaime</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

694
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,485
<i>Come on, men.</i>

695
00:49:56,892 --> 00:50:00,227
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

696
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:02,129
I'm famished, actually.

697
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:05,266
<i>I think we've got a spare</i>
<i>partridge on the fire.</i>

698
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:08,103
Well, I do like partridge.

699
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:17,513
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

700
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,452
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

701
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,354
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic--

702
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,490
ah!

703
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,692
On the stump.

704
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,001
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

705
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,105
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

706
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,241
and lick your boots.

707
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:48,776
- My father--
- And if you get in any trouble,

708
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,679
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

709
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:54,748
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

710
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,253
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

711
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:06,559
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

712
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:12,599
You're nothing
without your daddy,

713
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:16,069
and your daddy
ain't here.

714
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:18,538
Never forget that.

715
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:22,276
Here, this should
help you remember.

716
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:33,588
<i>A bear there was,</i>
<i>a bear, a bear</i>

717
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:37,258
<i>All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered with hair</i>

718
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:40,528
<i>Three boys, a goat,</i>
<i>and a dancing bear</i>

719
00:51:40,562 --> 00:51:44,332
<i>They danced and spun</i>
<i>right to the fair</i>

720
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:47,902
<i>How sweet she was,</i>
<i>so pure and fair</i>

721
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:51,639
<i>The maid with honey</i>
<i>up in her hair</i>

722
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:55,176
<i>He smelled her all</i>
<i>in the summer air</i>

723
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,212
<i>The maid with honey</i>
<i>up in her hair</i>

724
00:51:58,246 --> 00:52:02,183
<i>From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to there</i>

725
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:05,887
<i>All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair</i>

726
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:09,123
<i>He smelled that girl</i>
<i>in the summer air</i>

727
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:12,727
- <i>The bear, the bear</i>
- <i>The maiden fair</i>

728
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:17,198
<i>Oh, I'm a maid</i>
<i>and I'm pure and fair</i>

729
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:20,802
<i>I'll never dance</i>
<i>with a hairy bear</i>

730
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:24,572
<i>I called a knight,</i>
<i>but you're a bear</i>

731
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:27,641
<i>All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair</i>

732
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:31,379
<i>From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to there</i>

733
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:35,150
<i>All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair</i>

734
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:38,453
<i>He smelled that girl</i>
<i>in the summer air</i>

735
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:43,125
- <i>The bear, the bear</i>
- <i>The maiden fair.</i>
