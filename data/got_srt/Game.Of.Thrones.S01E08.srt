1
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,828
Yah! Left high, left low.

2
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,556
Right low, lunge right.

3
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,395
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

4
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,940
What is...

5
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,036
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

6
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,247
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

7
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,916
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

8
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,752
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

9
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,088
Hush!

10
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,715
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,261
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

12
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,305
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as l told you.

13
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,432
Run!

14
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,688
This way!

15
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,620
Left, right. Rah!

16
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,957
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
but you went left.

18
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,504
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

19
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,758
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

20
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,137
- You were not seeing.
- l was so. l watched, but you...

21
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,391
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

22
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,147
The seeing, the true seeing,

23
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,649
that is the heart of swordplay.

24
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:01,033
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

25
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,331
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

26
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,041
in place of his own?

27
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,669
- l am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

28
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,965
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

29
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,305
And l don't have to go
with you if l don't want.

30
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,682
Take her.

31
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,686
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

32
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,939
Get out of my way, little man.

33
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,317
l am Syrio Forel...

34
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,277
Foreign bastard.

35
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,867
..and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

36
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,329
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

37
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,708
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

38
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,294
Run to your father.

39
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,858
Bloody oafs.

40
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,071
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

41
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,701
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

42
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,840
What do we say

43
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,467
to the god of death?

44
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,303
Not today.

45
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,056
Go.

46
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
Not today. Not today.

47
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,513
Stay away from me.
l'll tell my father.

48
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,349
l'll... l'll tell the queen.

49
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,061
Who do you think sent me?

50
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
Needle.

51
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,705
There she is.

52
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,124
- What do you want?
- l want you, wolf girl.

53
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,835
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

54
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,630
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me the queen!

55
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,299
Stay away!

56
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,331
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

57
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,002
Varys.

58
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,256
l promise you it isn't poisoned.

59
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,468
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

60
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,395
Not so much, my lord.

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,689
l would save the rest, if l were you.

62
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,651
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

63
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,697
What about my daughters?

64
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,200
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

65
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,911
Even my little birds cannot find her.

66
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,247
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

67
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,251
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

68
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,214
all dead, it grieves me to say.
l do so hate the sight of blood.

69
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,718
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

70
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,137
And would again, my lord.

71
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,433
l was unarmed, unarmoured
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

72
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,686
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

73
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,236
What madness led you to tell the queen

74
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,864
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

75
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,201
The madness of mercy.

76
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,624
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

77
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,919
lt's always
the innocents who suffer.

78
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,130
lt wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

79
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,592
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

80
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,096
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

81
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,853
l trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

82
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:29,736
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

83
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,366
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

84
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,369
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

85
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,750
lf that's true,

86
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,921
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

87
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,048
Not today, my lord.

88
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,804
Tell me something, Varys.

89
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,640
Who do you truly serve?

90
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,519
The realm, my lord.

91
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,646
Someone must.

92
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,668
lt's Othor, without a doubt.

93
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,216
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
Iess the hand the wolf tore off.

94
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,761
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

95
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,848
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, l'd say.

96
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,601
- Mmm.
- The smell.

97
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,647
What smell?

98
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,734
There is none.

99
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,530
lf they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

100
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,535
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

101
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,870
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

102
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,499
l want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,671
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

104
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,675
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

105
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,011
Lord Commander

106
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,807
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

107
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,685
A raven from King's Landing.

108
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,312
Come on, move 'em out.

109
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,742
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

110
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,037
and pour one for yourself.

111
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,425
The king is dead.

112
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,064
ls there any word of my father?

113
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,192
Sit.

114
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,449
Lord Stark has been

115
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,284
charged with treason.

116
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,163
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

117
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,208
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

118
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,264
l hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

119
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,809
Your duty lies here now.

120
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,771
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

121
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,275
l'm sure they'll be

122
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,069
treated gently.

123
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,076
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

124
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,079
King Robert's body was still warm

125
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,291
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

126
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,877
He wouldn't do that.

127
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,672
He knows how much
l love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

128
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,716
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

129
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,387
Send for my father. He'll tell you
the king was his friend.

130
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,391
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

131
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,977
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

132
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,354
How can l allow you to marry my son?

133
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,357
A child born of a traitor's seed

134
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,776
is no fit consort for our king.

135
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,362
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

136
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,908
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

137
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,036
No, l'm not. l'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

138
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,541
l'll be a queen just like you, l promise.
l won't hatch anything.

139
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,253
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

140
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,382
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

141
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,059
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

142
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,770
- what's his name?
- Robb.

143
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,024
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

144
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,278
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

145
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,615
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

146
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,784
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

147
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:38,086
lf... If l could see my father,
talk to him about...

148
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,090
You disappoint me, child.

149
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,594
We have told you
of your father's treason.

150
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,930
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

151
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,933
l only meant that...

152
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,228
What will happen to him?

153
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,232
- That depends.
- On...

154
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,944
- On what?
- On your brother.

155
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,949
And on you.

156
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,084
Treason?

157
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,670
Sansa wrote this?

158
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,172
lt is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

159
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,260
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

160
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,471
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

161
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,475
This is a royal command, my lord.

162
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,271
- If you should refuse to obey...
- l won't refuse.

163
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,358
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
l'll go to King's Landing.

164
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,361
But not alone.

165
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,240
Call the banners.

166
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
All of them, my lord?

167
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,704
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

168
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,664
They have.

169
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,916
Now we see
what their words are worth.

170
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,170
Yes.

171
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
Are you afraid?

172
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,685
l must be.

173
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,228
Good.

174
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,941
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

175
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,217
You've had this since dawn?

176
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,720
He sent it to me, not you.

177
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,058
- l've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

178
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,268
My husband has been taken prisoner.

179
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,772
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

180
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,233
Your son against the Lannisters?

181
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,779
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

182
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,032
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

183
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,660
He is your brother by law!

184
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,746
Does family mean nothing to you?

185
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,624
Family means everything to me.

186
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,501
And l will not risk Robin's life

187
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,295
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

188
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,590
- l'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

189
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,551
You just ate.

190
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,470
You will not support us, then?
Do l understand you correctly?

191
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,266
- But l'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

192
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,436
You're always welcome here, sister.

193
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,690
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to fight...

194
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,942
That is what l ask.

195
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,904
Go on, sweet.

196
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,031
Time for your bath.

197
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,576
l'll feed you after.

198
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,124
lf you fear for the safety of your son...

199
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,252
Of course l fear
for the safety of my son!

200
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,296
Are you an idiot?

201
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,798
They killed my husband.

202
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,301
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

203
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,930
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

204
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,520
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

205
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,230
where they belong,

206
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,524
to protect their lord.

207
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,081
Will you shut up?

208
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,170
There's hill tribes all around here.

209
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,133
lf l'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

210
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,595
l should just take your food
and leave you here.

211
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,305
Eh?

212
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,351
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

213
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,103
You don't think l'd do it, do you?

214
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,650
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

215
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,735
Golden women?

216
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,071
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

217
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:17,282
for as long as l'm around
and not a moment longer.

218
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,244
But you knew that.

219
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,331
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honour.

220
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,584
Fair enough.

221
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,587
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

222
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,882
and ''my lord'' you
every time you take a shit.

223
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,511
l'm not your toady
and l'm not your friend.

224
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,847
Though l would treasure
your friendship,

225
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,141
l'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

226
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,894
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

227
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,604
remember this

228
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,356
whatever their price,

229
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,024
l'll beat it.

230
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,193
l like living.

231
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,993
Tyrion.

232
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,496
Tyrion.

233
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,377
Tyrion.

234
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,234
Come, share our fire.

235
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,571
Help yourselves to our goat.

236
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,121
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

237
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:51,835
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

238
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,130
l am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

239
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,300
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

240
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,180
ln my own bed,
at the age of 80

241
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,849
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock.

242
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,565
Take the halfman.

243
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,610
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

244
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,904
No, no, no, no, no!

245
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,990
My... My house is rich and powerful.

246
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,161
lf you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

247
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,705
We have no use
for a halfman's promises.

248
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,168
Halfman maybe, but at least l have
the courage to face my enemies.

249
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:37,130
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

250
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,716
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

251
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,803
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

252
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,808
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

253
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,977
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

254
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:59,069
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

255
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:14,334
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

256
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,922
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

257
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,216
l will not give you trinkets.

258
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,844
l will give you this.

259
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,305
What is ''this''?

260
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,017
The Vale of Arryn.

261
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,353
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

262
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,649
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

263
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,362
l believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

264
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,247
Now there's a rare sight...

265
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,335
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

266
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,389
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

267
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,937
Blood will always tell.

268
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,023
You'll hang for this, bastard.

269
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,671
l told you not to do anything stupid.

270
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,132
You're confined to quarters. Go.

271
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,826
Ghost, what's wrong?

272
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,830
ls someone out there?

273
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,238
Commander?

274
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,077
Stay.

275
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,841
Hello?

276
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,977
Who's there?

277
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,569
Lord Commander?

278
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,806
Snow?

279
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,933
Commander!

280
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,907
Move!

281
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,845
What did they do?

282
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,223
Lamb men make good slaves.

283
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,934
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers,

284
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,061
and the slavers will give us gold...

285
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,652
...and silk, and steel.

286
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:54,698
l thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

287
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,868
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

288
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,746
ships to sail to Westeros.

289
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,223
Jorah, make them stop.

290
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,350
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

291
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,020
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

292
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,397
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

293
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,608
The riders do her honour.

294
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,944
lf her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

295
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,112
l will bring you her tongue.

296
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:40,035
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

297
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,038
l do not have a gentle heart, ser.

298
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:47,000
Do as l command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

299
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:55,508
Mago!

300
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:57,508
Only while blood of my blood still lives.

301
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:03,266
- Come.
- She is my prize. I will take her with an arakh.

302
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,232
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

303
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,734
And those women there.

304
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,113
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

305
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,448
l can,

306
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,367
and l will.

307
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:26,658
It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize

308
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,959
or I will take it with my arakh.

309
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:34,977
She will speak before me
until then you will keep yourself quite.

310
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,261
Moon of my life,

311
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,390
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

312
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:46,977
a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.

313
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,897
Tell me the truth of this.

314
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,736
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.

315
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,822
l have claimed many daughters this day...

316
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,449
...so they cannot be mounted.

317
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,038
This is the way of war.

318
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,081
These women are slaves now...

319
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,418
...to do with as we please.

320
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,838
lt pleases me to keep them safe.

321
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:19,167
lf your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.

322
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,180
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

323
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,184
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

324
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,686
You are a foreigner.

325
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,855
You do not command me.

326
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,859
l am Khaleesi. l do command you.

327
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,197
See how fierce she grows?

328
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:44,618
That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,

329
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:48,163
filling her with his fire.

330
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,291
l will hear no more.

331
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,919
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.

332
00:29:55,212 --> 00:30:00,551
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.

333
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,345
Be still.

334
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,557
Don't move!

335
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:16,525
l will not have your body burned.

336
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,445
l will not give you that honour.

337
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,119
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

338
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,372
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

339
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:40,382
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

340
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:46,054
...until nothing is left of you but bones!

341
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,517
First you have to kill me.

342
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,686
l already have.

343
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,291
My sun and stars is hurt.

344
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,376
A scratch...

345
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,086
...moon of my life.

346
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,922
Where are the healers?

347
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,008
This is the bite of a fly.

348
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:26,553
l can help the great rider with his cut.

349
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:31,600
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.

350
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,186
She is mine. Let her speak.

351
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,313
Thank you, silver lady.

352
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,109
Who are you?

353
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,321
l am named Mirri Maz Duur.
l was the godswife of this temple.

354
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,656
Witch.

355
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,075
My mother was
godswife here before me.

356
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,994
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

357
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,956
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

358
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,083
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

359
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:01,463
Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.

360
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,966
Lamb or lion,

361
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:08,136
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

362
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,266
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...

363
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,768
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

364
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:42,546
For 30 years l've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

365
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,215
l'm the man you want
Ieading the vanguard.

366
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,844
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

367
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,555
The bloody wall will melt

368
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,892
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

369
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:59,813
l will lead the van
or l will take my men

370
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,107
and march them home.

371
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,740
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

372
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,826
And when l am done
with the Lannisters,

373
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,747
l will march back north,
root you out of your keep

374
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,499
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

375
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,960
Oathbreaker, is it?!

376
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:28,592
l'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

377
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,775
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

378
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,860
against your liege lord.

379
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,989
But doubtless the Great Jon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

380
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,536
Your meat...

381
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,377
is bloody tough.

382
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:37,578
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

383
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,043
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

384
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:49,047
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

385
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,675
l don't want them to know
we're coming.

386
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:56,555
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

387
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,725
Can't l come with you?
l can ride now.

388
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,978
You've seen me riding.
And l won't get in the way, l...

389
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,647
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

390
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,984
Until l return that will be you.

391
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:14,781
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

392
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,828
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

393
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:24,041
- l will.
- l'll send letters whenever l can,

394
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:28,128
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

395
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:35,469
Until l return.

396
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,117
How long have you been
hiding out there?

397
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,329
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

398
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:07,334
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

399
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,796
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

400
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,967
No, they won't.

401
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,932
Please watch over Robb.

402
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:25,143
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

403
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,396
And Theon too, l suppose.

404
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,445
You hear them, boy?

405
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,074
The old gods are answering you.

406
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:43,537
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

407
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,042
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

408
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:53,547
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

409
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,845
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

410
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,265
l'm not complaining, little lord,

411
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,476
just telling truths.

412
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,023
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

413
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,401
You asked them,
they're answering you.

414
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,863
Shh.

415
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,366
Open your ears.

416
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,788
lt's only the wind.

417
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,584
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

418
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,504
They see you, boy.

419
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,090
They hear you.

420
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,469
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

421
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,180
The old gods have
no power in the South.

422
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:47,017
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

423
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,645
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

424
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,610
Well, there's a big man.

425
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,863
He has giants' blood
in him or l'm the queen.

426
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,075
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

427
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,577
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

428
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,874
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

429
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,420
Giants and worse than giants.

430
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,217
l tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

431
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,679
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

432
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,806
North, not south!

433
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,521
The cold winds are rising.

434
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,873
They were touched by white walkers.

435
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,208
That's why they came back.

436
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,669
That's why their eyes turned blue.

437
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,839
Only fire will stop them.

438
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,428
- How do you know that?
- l read about it in a book...

439
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,514
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

440
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,062
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

441
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,524
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

442
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,484
And when they wake up...

443
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,281
And when they wake up, what?

444
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,703
l hope the Wall's high enough.

445
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,905
Summer snows, my lady.

446
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,658
Robb's brought the North with him.

447
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,626
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

448
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:21,171
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

449
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,841
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

450
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:27,094
One army or two,
the kings in the North

451
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,931
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

452
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,103
Mother!

453
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,151
You look well.

454
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:47,281
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

455
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,325
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

456
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,744
l had not thought to be here.

457
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,205
l would speak with my son alone.

458
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,583
l know you will forgive me, my lords.

459
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,877
You heard her!
Move your arses!

460
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,254
Come on, out.

461
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,299
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

462
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,009
Have no fear, my lady.

463
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,720
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

464
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,556
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

465
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,350
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

466
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,686
You're not wasting away, are you?

467
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,201
l remember the day
you came into this world,

468
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,828
red-faced and squalling.

469
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:39,041
And now l find you leading a host to war.

470
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,961
- There was no one else.
- No one?

471
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,130
Who were those men l saw here?

472
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:49,301
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

473
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,553
lf you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

474
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,014
Oh, would that l could.

475
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,311
There was...

476
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,438
a letter.

477
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,068
From Sansa.

478
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,362
From the queen, you mean.

479
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,540
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

480
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,970
How many men do you have?

481
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,013
18,000.

482
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,391
lf l go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

483
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,435
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

484
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,231
Our best hope,
our only hope,

485
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,735
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if l lose?

486
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,321
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

487
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,616
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

488
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,119
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

489
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,746
And the years have not made him kinder.

490
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,252
lf you lose,

491
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,339
your father dies, your sisters die,

492
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,508
we die.

493
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,014
Well, that makes it simple, then.

494
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,474
l suppose it does.

495
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:46,210
From here it might be best
if Bronn and l continue alone.

496
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,629
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

497
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,506
Not best for me.

498
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,675
lf the halfman betrays us,

499
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,554
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

500
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,432
And feed it to the goats, yes.

501
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,811
All right, then.

502
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,980
Time to meet my father.

503
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,015
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

504
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,017
Father.

505
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,605
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

506
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,067
Sorry to disappoint you.

507
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:54,444
And who are these...

508
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,655
companions of yours?

509
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,743
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

510
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,871
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

511
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:08,375
Timett, son of Timett
ruler of the Burned Men.

512
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:13,297
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

513
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,340
leader of the Black Ears.

514
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,843
And here we have Bronn, son of...

515
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,055
You wouldn't know him.

516
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:26,018
May l present my lord father,

517
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,770
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

518
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:32,107
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

519
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,278
Kind of you to go to war for me.

520
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,158
You left us no choice.

521
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,577
The honour of the house was at stake.

522
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:48,040
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

523
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,584
We have our differences, Jaime and l.

524
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,794
He's braver. l'm better-looking.

525
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:55,464
He's been covering himself in glory.

526
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,300
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

527
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:02,304
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

528
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,349
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

529
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,435
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

530
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,439
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

531
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:17,319
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

532
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,032
My sister rules, you mean.

533
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,284
Stark's son has called his banners.

534
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:28,705
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

535
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,626
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

536
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:38,423
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

537
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,175
You'd like him.

538
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,222
While we're on the subject of war,

539
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,391
l made promises to my friends here,

540
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,852
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

541
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,855
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

542
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,065
plus swords, pikes,

543
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,025
gorgets, maces...

544
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,404
lf it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

545
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,990
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

546
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:08,745
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

547
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:12,040
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

548
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:16,503
And send word to Jaime
that l am moving against Robb Stark.

549
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,505
At once, my lord.

550
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,313
lt is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

551
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:36,190
Ride with me against my enemies

552
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:39,109
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

553
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,570
Only if the halfman fights with us.

554
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,323
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

555
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,868
the little lion's life is ours.

556
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:56,168
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

557
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,213
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

558
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,301
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

559
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:07,221
Do that and the river lords will join us.

560
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,933
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

561
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,436
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

562
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,814
''The late Lord Frey'' my father calls him.

563
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,693
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

564
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,739
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

565
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,457
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

566
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,668
So what's it going to be?

567
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:41,505
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

568
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:49,388
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

569
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,601
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
Ieaving this tent with his head.

570
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:59,898
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

571
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,150
He looked to be counting.

572
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,954
How high did you get?

573
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,168
20,000. Maybe more.

574
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,754
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

575
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:26,842
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

576
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,471
And he understands honour...

577
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,100
and courage.

578
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,354
Let him go.

579
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,149
Robb.

580
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:57,664
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

581
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,169
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

582
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,548
Yes, my lord.

583
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,675
Thank you, my lord.

584
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,938
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

585
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,689
You call me boy again.

586
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,901
Go on.

587
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,462
Oi.

588
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,263
It is also the wish of His Grace

589
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:58,308
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

590
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,229
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

591
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:06,942
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...

592
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,360
Lord Gyles.

593
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,780
..and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

594
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:15,450
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

595
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:20,455
after him until the end of time.

596
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,005
ln the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

597
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,426
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

598
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:36,972
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

599
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:40,350
be appointed Hand of the King.

600
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,352
Lastly,

601
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:45,272
in these times of treason and turmoil,

602
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,400
it is the view of council

603
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,570
that the life and safety

604
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,614
of King Joffrey

605
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:57,868
be of paramount importance.

606
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,039
Ser Barristan Selmy.

607
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,924
Your Grace,
l am yours to command.

608
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,009
Rise, Ser Barristan.

609
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,970
You may remove your helm.

610
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,645
You have served the realm
Iong and faithfully.

611
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,524
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

612
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,944
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

613
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,821
lt is time to rest
and look back with pride

614
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,824
on your many years of service.

615
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:41,245
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

616
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,874
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

617
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,795
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

618
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,548
You let my father die.

619
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,509
You're too old to protect anybody.

620
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,514
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

621
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,058
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

622
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,895
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

623
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,064
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

624
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,066
Careful, ser.

625
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,279
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

626
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:17,906
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

627
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,742
with servants
to look after your every need.

628
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,830
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

629
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,459
l am a knight.

630
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,588
l shall die a knight.

631
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,637
A naked knight, apparently.

632
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:55,694
Even now l could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

633
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,950
Here, boy!

634
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,703
Melt it down and add it to the others.

635
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,263
lf any man in this hall
has other matters

636
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,059
to set before His Grace,
Iet him speak now

637
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,686
or go forth and hold his silence.

638
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,650
Your Grace.

639
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,819
Come forward, my lady.

640
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,698
The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

641
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:46,370
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

642
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,413
l do.

643
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:56,755
As it please Your Grace,
l ask mercy for my father,

644
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,424
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

645
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,719
Treason is a noxious weed.

646
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,849
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

647
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,685
l want to hear what she says.

648
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,728
Thank you, Your Grace.

649
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,356
Do you deny your father's crime?

650
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:18,235
No, my lords.
l know he must be punished.

651
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:20,988
All l ask is mercy.

652
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,782
l know my lord father
must regret what he did.

653
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,909
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

654
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,703
You all know he loved him.

655
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:32,499
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

656
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,378
They must have lied to him
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

657
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,338
They must have lied!

658
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,883
He said l wasn't the king.

659
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,179
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

660
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,265
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

661
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:52,186
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

662
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,231
A child's faith.

663
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,650
Such sweet innocence.

664
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:03,530
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

665
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:08,160
Treason is treason!

666
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,498
Anything else?

667
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,837
lf you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

668
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,049
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

669
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,852
Your sweet words have moved me.

670
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,899
But your father has to confess.

671
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:42,444
He has to confess
and say that l'm the king...

672
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,449
or there'll be no mercy for him.

673
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,122
He will.
