1
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:04,335
Did you have to bury her in a place
like this?

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,872
She was my sister.
This is where she belongs.

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:10,838
The Boltons have Winterfell.

4
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,919
You'll be marrying his son and heir,
Ramsay.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,999
You loved your family.
Avenge them.

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:19,091
Does your mother like it here?

7
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,829
So wonderful to have her
watching over you.

8
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,940
But you'll always be her baby boy.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,746
I want you to be happy, Mother.

10
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,913
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

11
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,906
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

12
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:34,449
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,921
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,290
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive.

15
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,074
Hypocrisy is a boil.

16
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:46,021
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

17
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,417
You shall be punished.

18
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:50,122
We must protect one another.

19
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:55,188
Myrcella is in Dorne, surrounded by people
who hate our family.

20
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:56,450
Your brother was murdered.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,394
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.

22
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:00,998
The Sand Snakes are with me.

23
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:02,381
They will avenge their father

24
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,960
while you sit here, doing nothing.

25
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,341
I'm bringing our daughter home.

26
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,642
A one-handed man? Alone?

27
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:10,254
Who said I was going alone?

28
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,272
Conquerors always meet with resistance.

29
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:19,961
Sons of the Harpy, they want to put
a collar back on all of our necks.

30
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,566
All they understand is blood.

31
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,160
Volantis is a large city.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,290
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases tenfold.

33
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,685
I'm taking you to the Queen.

34
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,828

45
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:49,015
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

46
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,186
The Sapphire Isle.

47
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:59,025
Why are we on a merchant ship?

48
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,860
Why no Lannister sails?

49
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,498
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

50
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,168
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

51
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:10,670
row ourselves to the Dornish
shore in the night.

52
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,706
You ever been to Dorne?

53
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,675
- No.
- I have.

54
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,427
The Dornish are crazy.

55
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,513
All they want to do is fight
and fuck, fuck and fight.

56
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,515
You should be happy to go back.

57
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,385
There's nothing
like a good fight

58
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,720
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

59
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,023
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

60
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:32,225
to clear your head
for the next fight.

61
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,444
It's how the two work together.

62
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,646
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

63
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,231
Well, I am.

64
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:41,034
But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

65
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,069
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

66
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,121
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

67
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:48,241
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

68
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,542
Your niece?

69
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,003
I've been doing this sort
of thing a long time.

70
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:02,055
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

71
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,340
I know.
Why are you here?

72
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,593
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

73
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,145
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

74
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,015
Because I don't want
to start a war.

75
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:15,401
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

76
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:19,572
It has to be me.

77
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:25,495
If I'm putting something
like this together,

78
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,530
a one-handed man
who happens to be

79
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:30,283
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not--

80
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,168
It has to be me.

81
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,459
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

82
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:43,963
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

83
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:47,600
Varys set him free.

84
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:56,559
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

85
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,227
give him my regards.

86
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,317
He murdered my father.

87
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:10,039
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

88
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,493
And then I'll give
him your regards.

89
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,337
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

90
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,140
Given the expense of
rebuilding the royal fleet--

91
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:28,474
How much can the crown afford?

92
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,076
<i>With winter coming,</i>

93
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,513
half what they ask, less?

94
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:36,816
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

95
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,851
House Tyrell could
front the gold

96
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,987
and the crown would
pay us back in time

97
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,690
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

98
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:51,531
You've already
given us too much.

99
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:55,535
No, we must arrange better
terms with the Iron Bank.

100
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:58,204
- Absolutely.
- In person.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,875
- Me? - We must send an envoy
to the Iron Bank,

102
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,546
someone of importance to show
these bankers our respect.

103
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:09,549
As the king's Master of Coin, I can
think of no one more qualified.

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,684
I would be honored, Your Grace.

105
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,638
The king's expressed concern about his
father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

106
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:23,229
He's ordered Ser Meryn to
personally lead your escort.

107
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,983
My very own Kingsguard?

108
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,068
- Please express my--
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

109
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,070
Of course.
Of course.

110
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:34,991
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

111
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,826
(laughs)

112
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:47,136
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

113
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,505
Not small enough.

114
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,769
Cersei: May I offer you
some wine, Your Holiness?

115
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,737
No.

116
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:10,777
The old High Septon would
have asked the vintage.

117
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:13,863
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

118
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,449
and should be kept pure.

119
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:19,669
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

120
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:21,838
Hmm.

121
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:24,290
How may I serve?

122
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:29,128
All over Westeros we hear
of septs being burned,

123
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,315
Silent Sisters raped,

124
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,967
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

125
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:38,521
Wars teach people to obey
the sword, not the gods.

126
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:41,524
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

127
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,543
<i>In the days before</i>
<i>the Targaryens,</i>

128
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,979
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

129
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:51,501
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

130
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:55,071
If I explain their holy
purpose to my son the king,

131
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,240
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

132
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,408
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

133
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,030
An army that defends the bodies
and souls of the common people?

134
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:06,999
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

135
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,001
And to you, of course,

136
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:11,387
as the chosen representative
of the Seven.

137
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,006
An honor I never expected.

138
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,892
Or, indeed, ever wished for.

139
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:17,926
Which is why you were chosen.

140
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:22,098
You and I both know
how the world works.

141
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,333
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

142
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,169
beyond the reach of justice.

143
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:29,939
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

144
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,159
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

145
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:41,784
What would you say if I told you of
a great sinner in our very midst?

146
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,770
Shielded by gold and privilege.

147
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,375
May the Father judge him justly.

148
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,714

This is Lord Petyr
Baelish's establishment.

00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:03,916

00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:16,879
Faith Militant:
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

166
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,298
<i>Boy fucker.</i>

167
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:22,301
<i>You buggering filth!</i>

168
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:25,721
There's a special place in the
seventh hell for your kind.

169
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:28,441
Man: Please.
Please, I'll pay.

170
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,476
I'll-- I'll pay
all of you.

171
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,645
Yes, you will.

172
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,900

Seize him.

- Sinner.
- (grunting)

178
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:12,601
Loras:
Get your hands off me.

179
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,186
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,

180
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:16,322
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

181
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,491
Who do you think you are?

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,994
Justice.

183
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:30,753
Why is my brother in a cell?

184
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:33,339
I-I don't know.

185
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,091
I-I didn't order it.

186
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,376
We both know who did.

187
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:41,464
You told me she was
returning to Casterly Rock.

188
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,849
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

189
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,352
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

190
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,221
<i>Arresting my brother</i>
<i>is her revenge.</i>

191
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:51,390
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

192
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:53,526
(huffs)

193
00:13:57,064 --> 00:14:00,866
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

194
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,929
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

195
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,208
Of course I do.

196
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:11,077
You're my queen.

197
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:13,496
I can't bear
to think of my brother

198
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,298
locked away in some grimy cell.

199
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,720
I'll set him free for you.

200
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,304
Do you promise?

201
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,731
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

202
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,649
Did I arrest him?

203
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:37,436
Well, no.

204
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,822
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

205
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:43,409
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

206
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,694
I did.

207
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:49,782
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

208
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,535
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

209
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:55,171
no matter his perversions.

210
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,039
Then...

211
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,127
can I tell Margaery you'll
have Ser Loras released?

212
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,846
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

213
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,848
You're the king.

214
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,633
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

215
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:10,186
he'll release the poor boy.

216
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,976
Halt!

217
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:27,536
<i>(coughing, chatter)</i>

218
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:42,918
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

219
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:47,807
Give the order and we'll
clear out this rabble.

220
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:52,061
You mean, kill them?

221
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:53,896
Here at the sept?

222
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,091
You'd be sending them to meet
the gods that they love.

223
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,188
Man:
<i>Bastard!</i>

224
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,406
Man #2:
<i>You're an abomination!</i>

225
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:11,697
Man #3:
<i>Born of sin!</i>

226
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,999
Woman:
<i>Filthy bastard!</i>

227
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:20,923
We'll find another way.

228
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,710
Man #4:
<i>Abomination!</i>

229
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,384
My queen?

230
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,892
There was no way to free Ser
Loras without violence.

231
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:45,564
You're the King of the Andals,

232
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,283
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

233
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,535
<i>the Protector of the Realm,</i>

234
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,905
<i>and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother by law.</i>

235
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,908
I'm going to speak
with the High Sparrow.

236
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,993
Are you?
When?

237
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,964
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

238
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,550
He was praying just now.

239
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,471
I have to send word
to Grandmother.

240
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,808
Will you come back later?

241
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:17,146
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

242
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,232
Of course.

243
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,068
(grunting)

244
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,770
Selyse: You think
highly of this boy?

245
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,322
Good.

246
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,324
Stannis: Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

247
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:31,110
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

248
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:34,472
Perhaps, but that
wasn't Ned Stark's way.

249
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,952
I should have given you a son.

250
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:43,289
Not your fault.

251
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,257
Whose, then?

252
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,793
I gave you nothing but weakness.

253
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,214
And deformity.

254
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,185
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

255
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:58,187
My lady.

256
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,973
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

257
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:03,726
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

258
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,037
You march on Winterfell soon?

259
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:18,457
We must to beat the snows.

260
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:22,044
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

261
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,213
and left me behind.

262
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:28,717
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

263
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,469
I won't.

264
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,506
I need you.

265
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:37,176
You only need faith, my king.

266
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,682
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

267
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:48,237
To serve my Lord.

268
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,606
(grunting)

269
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,576
Lord Ashford.

270
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,051
Lady Caulfield.

271
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:06,255
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

272
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,140
I've never even heard
of these people.

273
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:10,726
They haven't heard
of you, either.

274
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,178
But we need men
and they have some.

275
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:18,317
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

276
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,736
More than Lord Wibberley.

277
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,452
- Not him.
- <i> I know, I'm sorry.</i>

278
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:38,837
But we need men and supplies

279
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,372
and Roose Bolton's
the Warden of the North.

280
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,757
He murdered my brother.

281
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:45,044
We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

282
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:48,547
We can't watch the Wall
with 50 men.

283
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:50,382
And we can't get more men

284
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,718
without help from
the Warden of the North.

285
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,793
Apologies, my lady.

286
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,886
<i>(door closes)</i>

287
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:31,373
Lord Commander.

288
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:33,792
How can I help you?

289
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:36,095
<i>Come with us when we ride south.</i>

290
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:39,398
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

291
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,850
Its hidden tunnels,
its weaknesses,

292
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:44,536
its people.

293
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:46,855
Winterfell was your home once.

294
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,859
Don't you want to chase
the rats out of it?

295
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,914
Castle Black is my home now.

296
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:59,551
<i>The Night's Watch take no part in
the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

297
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,620
There's only one war.

298
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,922
Life against death.

299
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:09,094
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

300
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,713
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

301
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:15,217
Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

302
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,105
No visions.
No magic.

303
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,141
Just life.

304
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:44,580
Do you feel my heart beating?

305
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:48,834
There's power in you.

306
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:51,804
You resist it,
and that's your mistake.

307
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:53,672
Embrace it.

308
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:07,519
The Lord of Light
made us male and female.

309
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,189
Two parts of a greater whole.

310
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:14,943
In our joining, there's power.

311
00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,496
Power to make life,

312
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,865
power to make light,

313
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,784
and power to cast shadows.

314
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,871
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

315
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,208
Then we shouldn't tell him.

316
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,711
- I can't.
- Why?

317
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,048
I swore a vow.

318
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,685
I loved another.

319
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,970
The dead don't need lovers.

320
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:44,273
Only the living.

321
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,563
I know.

322
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:53,649
But I still love her.

323
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,749
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

324
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:26,348
<i>(knocks on door)</i>

325
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:49,538
Are you lonely?

326
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,591
Just bored.

327
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,259
My father used
to tell me that boredom

328
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,928
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

329
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,596
Were you bored a lot, too?

330
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,198
I know Castle Black

331
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,633
is no place
for a child, but--

332
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:05,270
I like it. I thought
I'd be left at home.

333
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:07,940
I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

334
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:10,025
Why do you say that?

335
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:13,812
She told me, "I don't
want to bring you."

336
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:17,561
She shouldn't have said that.

337
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:29,411
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

338
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:43,308
When you were an infant,

339
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:46,812
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

340
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:50,182
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

341
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:55,253
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

342
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:59,274
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

343
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:02,527
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

344
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:09,562
I still remember how you smiled when
I put that doll in your cradle.

345
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,288
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

346
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:23,013
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

347
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:27,636
I was told you would die.

348
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:30,689
Or worse,

349
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:32,557
the greyscale would go slow.

350
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,727
<i>Let you grow just enough</i>
<i>to know the world</i>

351
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:38,030
<i>before taking it away from you.</i>

352
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:40,732
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

353
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,818
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

354
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:45,871
<i>before the sickness</i>
<i>spread through the castle.</i>

355
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,908
I told them all to go to hell.

356
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:54,379
<i>I called in every maester</i>
<i>on this side of the world.</i>

357
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:57,582
Every healer.
Every apothecary.

358
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,910
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

359
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,890
'Cause you did not belong
across the world

360
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:07,642
with the bloody Stone Men.

361
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:10,717
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

362
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:15,016
And you are my daughter.

363
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:34,286
<i>(water dripping)</i>

364
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,697
Littlefinger: <i>I thought
I might find you here.</i>

365
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,201
<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>

366
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:26,171
Father never talked about her.

367
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:30,759
Sometimes I'd find him down
here lighting the candles.

368
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,762
They say she was beautiful.

369
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:36,131
I saw her once.

370
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:39,267
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

371
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:42,971
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

372
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:45,056
Everyone was there.

373
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:48,560
The Mad King, your father,

374
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:50,145
Robert Baratheon,

375
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:52,063
and Lyanna.

376
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,950
She was already
promised to Robert.

377
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,818
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

378
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:00,405
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

379
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:02,207
watching these legendary men

380
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:05,126
tilting at the lists.

381
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,046
The last two riders
were Barristan Selmy

382
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,081
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

383
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:13,919
When Rhaegar won, everyone
cheered for their prince.

384
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,921
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet

385
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,923
and they saw that silver hair.

386
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:20,342
How handsome he was.

387
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:23,178
Until he rode
right past his wife,

388
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,230
Elia Martell,

389
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:27,182
and all the smiles died.

390
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,819
I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

391
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:35,273
He rode past his wife

392
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:39,277
and he lay a crown of winter
roses in Lyanna's lap.

393
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,413
Blue as frost.

394
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,835
How many tens of
thousands had to die

395
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,200
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

396
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,209
Yes, he chose her.

397
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,795
And then he kidnapped
her and raped her.

398
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,805
Come.

399
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,274
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

400
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:16,114
You're dressed for riding.

401
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,617
I am.

402
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,568
Where are you going?

403
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:22,570
King's Landing.

404
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:24,456
King's Landing?

405
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,324
Cersei sent for me.

406
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,077
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

407
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,745
You can't leave me here.

408
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:33,331
I know how hard it is to live
with people you despise.

409
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,050
Believe me.

410
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:37,052
But it won't be for long.

411
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:38,420
How do you know?

412
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:43,174
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

413
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:45,644
He'll march south
to King's Landing

414
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,646
before the winter snows
block his way.

415
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,649
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

416
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:53,184
- You don't know that.
- I do.

417
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,571
Once he liberates these
lands from the Boltons,

418
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:59,107
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

419
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:01,076
With the North behind him,

420
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,611
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

421
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:06,414
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

422
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,166
He has a larger army.

423
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,752
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

424
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:14,339
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

425
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,875
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

426
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:20,128
And if you're right?

427
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,047
Stannis takes Winterfell,

428
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,058
he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.

429
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:28,436
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

430
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:31,056
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

431
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:33,391
But I--

432
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:35,060
I wouldn't--

433
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:36,611
Wardeness of the North?

434
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:39,531
You are the last
surviving Stark.

435
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,282
He needs you.

436
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,567
And what if you're wrong?

437
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:44,319
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

438
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,038
Or he does and the
Boltons defeat him?

439
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:49,240
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

440
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:50,992
and make him yours.

441
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:52,877
I don't know how to do that.

442
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:54,713
Of course you do.

443
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,548
He's already fallen for you.

444
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,583
His father frightens me.

445
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:02,087
He should.
He's a dangerous man.

446
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:05,807
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

447
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:08,962
And you've learned to
maneuver from the very best.

448
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:13,348
I'll return before too long.

449
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,267
You'll be strong without me.

450
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,994
The North will be yours.

451
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,497
Do you believe me?

452
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:34,702
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

453
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:38,206
(pats)

454
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,461
(groans)

455
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:19,130
(panting)

456
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,062
<i>(blade scraping)</i>

457
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,185
Breakfast.

458
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:46,074
That would have been
a shit way to die.

459
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:49,194
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

460
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:52,614
Aye, but your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.

461
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:55,283
I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.

462
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,418
No?

463
00:32:57,453 --> 00:33:00,171
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

464
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,040
Sounds like a good song to me.

465
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,425
Sounds like all the rest.

466
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:09,047
What about you?

467
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:11,516
What shit way would you choose?

468
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:15,803
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

469
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:18,175
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

470
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:21,559
How disappointing.

471
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,779
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

472
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,065
I've had an exciting life.

473
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:29,308
I want my death to be boring.

474
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,787
How do you want to go?

475
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:35,240
In the arms of the woman I love.

476
00:33:38,577 --> 00:33:41,045
She want the same thing?

477
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,752
Let's go.

478
00:33:57,563 --> 00:33:59,597
The captain of that ship--

479
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:01,182
what was he, Braavosi?

480
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,934
Pentoshi.

481
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:04,602
And he's headed to Oldtown?

482
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,654
As I said.
Why?

483
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:09,490
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

484
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,160
and telling the locals that
Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

485
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:14,162
A bag of gold.

486
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:15,997
I'm not sure you understand

487
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:18,566
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

488
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,368
It was a heavy bag.

489
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:23,454
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

490
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:25,290
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

491
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:28,209
- <i> (horse neighs)</i>
- <i> (hoofbeats)</i>

492
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:36,768
Bronn:
<i>How many you count?</i>

493
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:38,136
Four.

494
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,854
How many do you think
you can take?

495
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,040
One if he's slow.

496
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:47,445
Halt!

497
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,564
Over the hill.

498
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:53,451
Fucked in the ass.

499
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,157
Hyah!

500
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:05,413
Morning, lads.

501
00:35:05,464 --> 00:35:07,498
Glad we found you.

502
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,967
Who are you?

503
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,969
Cooper.

504
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:13,304
This is Darnell.

505
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:14,672
You're from King's Landing.

506
00:35:14,723 --> 00:35:16,507
Accent gave me away?

507
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:20,094
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

508
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,846
Why are you here?

509
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:23,681
Our ship capsized in the night.

510
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:25,016
We managed to swim ashore.

511
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,852
It was a near thing, really.

512
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:30,355
Thought the sharks would get us.

513
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:33,441
There are no sharks in Dorne.

514
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,945
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

515
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:39,864
Dolphins, maybe.

516
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,034
Throw your swords in the sand.

517
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,837
Boys, there's no need for this.

518
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:48,339
Just point us
in the right direction,

519
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,091
we'll find our way home.

520
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,543
Swords in the sand now.

521
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,272
(grunts)

522
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:14,732
Hyah! Hyah!

523
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:18,236
(horse neighs)

524
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:22,163
That one should be slow enough.

525
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,664
(shouts)

526
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:02,196
(shouts)

527
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,841
(grunts)

528
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,795
Bronn:
<i>Nice move.</i>

529
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,132
Luck.

530
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,351
You had a wonderful teacher.

531
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:40,067
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

532
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,454
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

533
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:45,323
We'll ride to the Water Gardens

534
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:47,041
with a nice breeze in our faces.

535
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:49,236
First we need
to bury these bodies.

536
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:51,078
Birds have to eat, too.

537
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,570
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

538
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:56,000
We're not here to start a war.

539
00:37:56,002 --> 00:37:58,803
Do you know how long it'll take
us to dig all those holes?

540
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:02,006
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

541
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:03,925
Not at all, really.

542
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,041
Mama.

543
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,881
Nym, Obara.

544
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,017
Will it be war?

545
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:48,553
Prince Doran will weep for
your father, but nothing else.

546
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,888
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

547
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:54,225
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

548
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:57,028
We don't need an army
to start a war.

549
00:38:57,062 --> 00:39:00,815
<i>Queen Cersei loves her children.</i>

550
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,800
And we have one of them.

551
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,819
You may have a problem.

552
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:11,242
(groaning)

553
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:13,327
A ship's captain who
found me in Planky Town

554
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:14,996
claiming he had
information to sell.

555
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:19,000
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

556
00:39:20,302 --> 00:39:22,420
He's come for Myrcella.

557
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,172
If he gets to her before we do,

558
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:28,142
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

559
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:31,512
You must choose.

560
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,431
Doran's way and peace,

561
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,267
or my way and war.

562
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,023
I'm with you always.

563
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,608
Nym?

564
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:49,997
Obara?

565
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:53,918
When I was a child, Oberyn
came to take me to court.

566
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:55,670
I had never seen this man,

567
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:58,256
and yet he called
himself my father.

568
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,757
My mother wept,

569
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:03,044
said I was too young and a girl.

570
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,466
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

571
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:11,469
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

572
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,689
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

573
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:17,475
My father pointed to the spear

574
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,527
and then to my mother's tears.

575
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:23,531
(grunts)

576
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:29,487
I made my choice long ago.

577
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:34,709
(Tyrion muffled)
Will you untie me?

578
00:40:34,743 --> 00:40:37,745
<i>(muffled)</i>
<i>Will you please untie me?</i>

579
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:39,997
(muffled groan)
Will you please?

580
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:46,971
(muffled singing)

581
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,689
Thank you.

582
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:14,699
Who are you?

583
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:16,117
Your captor.

584
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,037
Do you have wine?

585
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:22,106
<i>No.</i>

586
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,008
Can't sleep without wine.

587
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,210
Then stay awake.

588
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:33,958
You're going the wrong way.

589
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:37,304
My sister is in Westeros.

590
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:40,191
Westeros is west.

591
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:41,726
We're heading east.

592
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:44,145
<i>I'm not taking you</i>
<i>to your sister.</i>

593
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,948
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

594
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:51,235
I am.
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

595
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:52,987
She's the queen I serve.

596
00:41:53,038 --> 00:41:55,656
(laughing)

597
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:02,913
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

598
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:05,416
It so happens I was
heading there myself.

599
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,585
What business would you
have with the queen?

600
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:11,222
Gold and glory.
Oh, and hate.

601
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:13,974
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

602
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,763
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

603
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,776
<i>A highborn knight from
the North of Westeros</i>

604
00:42:31,827 --> 00:42:34,328
down on his luck in Essos.

605
00:42:34,362 --> 00:42:38,365
Dragon epaulets,
bear sigil breastplate.

606
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:41,786
You're Jorah Mormont.

607
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,588
<i>I have to ask.</i>

608
00:42:44,623 --> 00:42:46,791
How exactly were you
serving your queen

609
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:49,627
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

610
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:52,296
Is it possible
that you were running?

611
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:54,882
Why would you be running?

612
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:57,118
And why would she
have sent you away?

613
00:42:57,152 --> 00:43:00,387
Oh, wait.

614
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:03,641
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

615
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:05,309
<i>It's all coming back to me.</i>

616
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,778
I was drunk through most of
the small council meetings,

617
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:09,530
but it's all coming back.

618
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:13,400
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

619
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:16,654
<i>She found out, didn't she?</i>

620
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:20,141
<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>

621
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:24,912
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

622
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:27,131
Risky scheme.

623
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,834
<i>One might even say desperate.</i>

624
00:43:31,386 --> 00:43:34,805
You think Daenerys will
execute me and pardon you?

625
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:38,618
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

626
00:43:57,362 --> 00:43:59,780
<i>(bird screeches)</i>

627
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:02,700
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

628
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:06,504
- (laughs)
- What?

629
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,422
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

630
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:10,541
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

631
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:12,343
into the streets
of King's Landing.

632
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:15,045
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

633
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:17,348
He liked to sing to them.

634
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:18,883
He sang to them?

635
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:20,885
- Yes.
- (laughs)

636
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:23,256
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

637
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:26,390
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

638
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:28,025
Just like all
the other minstrels.

639
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:29,226
And what did you do?

640
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:30,861
I made sure no one killed him.

641
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:33,898
And I collected the money.

642
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,283
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

643
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:38,485
- He was good?
- He was very good.

644
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:40,154
Viserys never told you?

645
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:43,290
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

646
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:44,992
Rhaegar never liked killing.

647
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:46,126
He loved singing.

648
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:48,245
And what did you do
with the money?

649
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:51,465
Well, one time, he gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.

650
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:54,168
One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.

651
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:57,972
One time, we got horribly drunk.

652
00:44:58,056 --> 00:44:59,840
(laughs)

653
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:02,009
Your Grace.

654
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,646
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

655
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,514
How many others are there?

656
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:10,568
50? 100?

657
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:12,570
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

658
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:16,407
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

659
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,943
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

660
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:21,528
Go, Ser Barristan.

661
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,947
Sing a song for me.

662
00:45:22,998 --> 00:45:25,449
Your Grace.

663
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:33,791
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

664
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:35,910
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

665
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:38,178
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

666
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:39,697
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

667
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:42,266
So their names would live on.

668
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,918
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

669
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:47,271
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

670
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:49,189
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

671
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:50,808
Is that what
you used to tell men

672
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,727
before you set them to
butchering each other for sport?

673
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:56,530
Your Grace, today is the traditional
start of the fighting season.

674
00:45:56,564 --> 00:45:58,482
I do not recognize
this tradition.

675
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:01,652
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

676
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:03,387
your city, together.

677
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:07,458
Without them, former
slaves and former masters

678
00:46:07,492 --> 00:46:09,653
have nothing in common.

679
00:46:10,662 --> 00:46:15,332
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

680
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:18,969
<i>I can't promise this is the
answer to all our problems,</i>

681
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:21,338
but it's a start.

682
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:29,930
(laughing)

683
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:34,151
(gurgling)

684
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:36,770

685

00:46:54,706 --> 00:46:57,091
