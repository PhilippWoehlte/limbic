3
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,537
The bastard of Winterfell.

4
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,709
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

5
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,083
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

6
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:49,000
You were pissing off the
edge if I remember right.

7
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,458
Picked up some scars along the road.

8
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,959
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

9
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

10
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,291
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

11
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,374
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

12
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,958
Unluckily for me.

13
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,001
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

14
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,374
Welcome to Dragonstone.

15
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,208
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

16
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,583
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

17
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:23,334
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

18
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,334
Of course.

19
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,501
Please, this way.

20
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,833
Where are you from?

21
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,124
I can't place the accent.

22
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,958
I was born on the Island of Naath.

23
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,042
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.

24
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,124
Palm trees and butterflies.

25
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,542
Haven't been, myself.

26
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,501
This place has changed.

27
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:29,000
And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.

28
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,501
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

29
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,083
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

30
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,249
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

31
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,166
Anyway...

32
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,000
she's much smarter than she lets on.

33
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,374
She's starting to let on.

34
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,292
Good.

35
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,333
At some point,

36
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,291
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

37
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,083
As long as you tell me how a Lannister

38
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,875
became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

39
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,000
A long and bloody tale.

40
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,751
To be honest, I was
drunk for most of it.

41
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,917
My bannermen think I'm
a fool for coming here.

42
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,333
Of course they do.

43
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:13,043
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

44
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,583
General rule of thumb...

45
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,708
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

46
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,458
True...

47
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,583
but I'm not a Stark.

48
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,084
I'd say you get used to them...

49
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,292
but you never really do.

50
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:51,084
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

51
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,042
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

52
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:10,042
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

53
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't you want to see him again?

54
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,124
I've done my part.

55
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,541
I've brought ice and fire together.

56
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,833
Strange.

57
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,333
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

58
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:26,000
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

59
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,374
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

60
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,583
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

61
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, I doubt that.

62
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,625
Give us common folk one taste of power,

63
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,458
we're like the lion who tasted man.

64
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,708
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

65
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,959
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

66
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,875
I did not part on good terms

67
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,875
with the King in the
North or his advisor.

68
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,876
Why?

69
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,584
Because of mistakes I made.

70
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,584
Terrible mistakes.

71
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,541
I would only be a
distraction if I stayed.

72
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,750
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

73
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,750
Good.

74
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't mind my saying,

75
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,750
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

76
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,209
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

77
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

78
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,124
- One last time.
- My lady...

79
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,708
I have to die in this strange country.

80
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,542
Just like you.

81
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,416
You stand in the presence

82
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,208
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

83
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,416
rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

84
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,374
rightful Queen of the
Andals and the First Men,

85
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,792
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

86
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,500
the Mother of Dragons,

87
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,708
the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

88
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,501
the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

89
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,292
This is Jon Snow.

90
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,084
He's King in the North.

91
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,958
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

92
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,208
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

93
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,792
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

94
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:59,792
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

95
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:02,666
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

96
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,500
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

97
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,750
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

98
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,666
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

99
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,291
I never did receive a formal education,

100
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,625
but I could have sworn I read

101
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:15,917
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

102
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:19,083
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

103
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:22,291
In exchange for his life and
the lives of the Northmen,

104
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:27,333
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

105
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,833
Or do I have my facts wrong?

106
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,166
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

107
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,583
No, of course not.

108
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,166
But still, an oath is an oath.

109
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,583
And perpetuity means...

110
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,042
what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

111
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:42,541
Forever.

112
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,625
Forever.

113
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,458
So I assume, my lord...

114
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,667
...you're here to bend the knee.

115
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,751
I am not.

116
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,875
Oh.

117
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,709
Well, that is unfortunate.

118
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,708
You've traveled all this way

119
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,875
to break faith with House Targaryen?

120
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,374
Break faith?

121
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,708
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

122
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,416
He burned my uncle alive.

123
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,750
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

124
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,834
My father... was an evil man.

125
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,876
On behalf of House Targaryen...

126
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,750
I ask your forgiveness

127
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,708
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

128
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,583
And I ask you not to judge a daughter

129
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,959
by the sins of her father.

130
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,917
Our two houses were
allies for centuries,

131
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,792
and those were the best centuries

132
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,917
the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

133
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,416
Centuries of peace and prosperity

134
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,249
with a Targaryen sitting
on the Iron Throne

135
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,249
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

136
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,000
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

137
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,416
Honor the pledge your
ancestor made to mine.

138
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,083
Bend the knee and I will
name you Warden of the North.

139
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,291
Together, we will save this country

140
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,918
from those who would destroy it.

141
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,792
You're right.

142
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:17,291
You're not guilty of
your father's crimes.

143
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:22,124
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

144
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,124
Then why are you here?

145
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,959
Because I need your
help, and you need mine.

146
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,124
Did you see three dragons

147
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
flying overhead when you arrived?

148
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,166
I did.

149
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,458
And did you see the Dothraki,

150
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,666
all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

151
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,625
They're hard to miss.

152
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:45,666
- But still, I need your help?
- Not to defeat Cersei.

153
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:49,000
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

154
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,249
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

155
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,374
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

156
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,000
Why not?

157
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,708
The only reason I can see

158
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,958
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

159
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,000
It's the fastest way to win the war,

160
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,833
but you won't do it,

161
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,042
which means, at the very least,

162
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,501
you're better than Cersei.

163
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,375
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

164
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,875
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

165
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,500
we're children playing at a game,

166
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,583
screaming that the rules aren't fair.

167
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,708
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

168
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,208
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

169
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,083
he's refused to bow, and
now he's calling me a child.

170
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,875
I believe he's calling all of
us children. Figure of speech.

171
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:40,208
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

172
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,374
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

173
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,042
As far as I can see, you
are the enemy to the north.

174
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:46,709
I am not your enemy.

175
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,042
The dead are the enemy.

176
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:51,584
The dead?

177
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,458
Is that another figure of speech?

178
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,083
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

179
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,166
The Army of the Dead?

180
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,333
You don't know me well, my lord,

181
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,666
but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

182
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,208
No, I don't think you're
either of those things.

183
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,333
The Army of the Dead is real.

184
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,792
The white walkers are real.

185
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,708
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

186
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,249
If they get past the Wall

187
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,751
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

188
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,375
we're finished.

189
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,250
I was born at Dragonstone.

190
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,583
Not that I can remember it.

191
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:37,042
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

192
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:40,249
Robert was your
father's best friend, no?

193
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,083
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

194
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,626
to murder a baby girl in her crib.

195
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,001
Not that it matters now, of course.

196
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,083
I spent my life in foreign lands.

197
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,458
So many men have tried to kill me,

198
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,958
I don't remember all their names.

199
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,042
I have been sold like a broodmare.

200
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,583
I've been chained and betrayed,

201
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:11,374
raped and defiled.

202
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
Do you know what kept me standing

203
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,583
through all those years in exile?

204
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,541
Faith.

205
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,792
Not in any gods,

206
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:25,333
not in myths and legends.

207
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,958
In myself.

208
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,124
In Daenerys Targaryen.

209
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,666
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

210
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,042
until my children were born.

211
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,833
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

212
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,208
They did for me.

213
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,666
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,

214
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,793
and I will.

215
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,666
You'll be ruling over a graveyard

216
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,001
if we don't defeat the Night King.

217
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,625
The war against my
sister has already begun.

218
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,000
You can't expect us to halt hostilities

219
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,833
and join you in fighting

220
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,334
whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

221
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,750
You don't believe him.

222
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,666
I understand that. It
sounds like nonsense.

223
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,458
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

224
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:22,666
it has also made Jon
Snow King in the North.

225
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,792
You were the first to
bring Dothraki to Westeros?

226
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,166
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

227
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,249
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

228
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,333
He was named King in the North.

229
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:33,708
Not because of his birthright.

230
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,083
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

231
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:41,124
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

232
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,834
because they believe in him.

233
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,208
All those things you don't believe in,

234
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,750
he faced those things.

235
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,958
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

236
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,541
He risked his life for his people.

237
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,333
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

238
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,084
He gave his own...

239
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,000
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

240
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:06,083
we will die.

241
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:09,750
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

242
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,083
If it doesn't matter, then
you might as well kneel.

243
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:14,249
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,

244
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,875
help her to defeat my sister,

245
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,042
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

246
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,792
There's no time for that.

247
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:21,708
There's no time for any of this!

248
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,208
While we stand here, debating...

249
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,166
It takes no time to bend the knee.

250
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,000
Pledge your sword to her cause.

251
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,751
And why would I do that?

252
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,750
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

253
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,958
but I don't know you.

254
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,792
As far as I can tell,

255
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:40,083
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

256
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,417
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

257
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:47,208
The lords of the North

258
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,042
placed their trust in me to lead them,

259
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:54,084
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

260
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,793
That's fair.

261
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,166
It's also fair to point out

262
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:04,291
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

263
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:08,042
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

264
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:09,958
you are in open rebellion.

265
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,249
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.

266
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,334
I have grave news.

267
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,750
You must forgive my manners.

268
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:31,124
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

269
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,876
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

270
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:44,667
Am I your prisoner?

271
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,959
Not yet.

272
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,083
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

273
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,541
were attacked en route to Dorne.

274
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,042
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

275
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,374
the rest, sunk or captured.

276
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,958
Ellaria and the Sand
Snakes, dead or captured.

277
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,541
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

278
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,250
All of them?

279
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:27,374
- Pull!
- Heave!

280
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,750
Pull!

281
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,459
Your sister's dead?

282
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,000
Euron has her.

283
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,375
You saw him take her?

284
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,042
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

285
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,542
I tried.

286
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,918
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

287
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,291
Come, men!

288
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,626
Sails up!

289
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,250
Murderer!

290
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,124
Whores!

291
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,459
Traitor!

292
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,584
This is the life.

293
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:39,458
Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.

294
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,374
I have to be honest,

295
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,334
this is making me hard.

296
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,042
Did you see Little Theon's face

297
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:54,416
right before he jumped overboard?

298
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,958
"Oh, no!"

299
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,417
What a twat.

300
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,125
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

301
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:05,750
My queen, please accept this gift

302
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:09,584
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

303
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:18,750
I give you what no
other man could give...

304
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,875
justice.

305
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:24,542
Justice for your murdered daughter.

306
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,083
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

307
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,750
and a true friend to the crown.

308
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:43,958
You deserve more than a true friend.

309
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:47,458
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

310
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:50,125
There's only one reward I want.

311
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,125
You shall have what
your heart desires...

312
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,709
when the war is won.

313
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,541
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

314
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,708
and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,

315
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,750
the sons and daughters of Westeros

316
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,042
shall defend our country.

317
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,291
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

318
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,042
The love of the people.

319
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,166
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

320
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:31,500
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

321
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,249
And if you turn on us,

322
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

323
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,958
Or yours.

324
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,083
They just like severed heads, really.

325
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,333
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

326
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,917
I would love to hear it.

327
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:48,958
When we have an hour or
two to speak as brothers.

328
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,666
Advice?

329
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,333
Does she like it gentle or rough?

330
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,000
A finger in the bum?

331
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,292
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not
now. We'll talk later.

332
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,083
I want you to know I understand.

333
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,666
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

334
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,334
I understand the fury that drives you.

335
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,833
I was there that day

336
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,626
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

337
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,500
If I close my eyes,

338
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,500
I can hear the sound of
Oberyn's skull breaking.

339
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,708
The sound of your scream.

340
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,208
I never heard a sound like that.

341
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,167
I thought, "That's true love."

342
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,042
Oberyn looked beautiful
that day. He really did.

343
00:23:45,043 --> 00:23:46,416
No one moved like him.

344
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,541
No one had such skill with a spear.

345
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,625
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

346
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:55,083
If only he hadn't taunted him.

347
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:59,042
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

348
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,083
But that wasn't your
lover's way, was it?

349
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,917
Now he's buried somewhere.

350
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,666
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

351
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,584
That must be difficult for you.

352
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,541
When my daughter was taken from me,

353
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:17,666
my only daughter...

354
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,458
well, you can't imagine how that feels

355
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,708
unless you've lost a child.

356
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:25,374
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

357
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,083
to give her to the wet nurse.

358
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:31,583
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

359
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,833
I never got to have a mother,

360
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,249
but Myrcella did.

361
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,917
She was mine, and you took her from me.

362
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:40,959
Why did you do that?

363
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,918
Doesn't matter now.

364
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,249
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

365
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,875
Those brown eyes.

366
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,584
Those lips.

367
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,249
Perfect Dornish beauty.

368
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,124
I imagine she's your favorite.

369
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,291
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

370
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,459
but still, we're only human.

371
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,541
We love whom we love.

372
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,416
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

373
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:26,792
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

374
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,626
It must be frustrating.

375
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,792
We all make our choices.

376
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:37,208
You chose to murder my daughter.

377
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,458
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

378
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,667
Do you feel powerful now?

379
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,625
I don't sleep very well.

380
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:52,000
Not at all, really.

381
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,917
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy

382
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:56,291
and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

383
00:25:56,292 --> 00:26:00,167
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

384
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,333
I thought about having Ser Gregor

385
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:05,500
crush your skull the
way he did Oberyn's.

386
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:10,208
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

387
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:13,167
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

388
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,001
She's so beautiful.

389
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,917
The thought of this lovely face

390
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:21,333
cracking open like a duck egg,

391
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,084
no, it's just not right.

392
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,666
Mama.

393
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,374
Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

394
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,458
Clever enough to learn what
poison you used to murder Myrcella.

395
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,124
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

396
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,209
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

397
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,042
How long does the poison take?

398
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:59,708
Difficult to say... hours, days.

399
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,583
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

400
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:05,084
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

401
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:13,333
Your daughter will
die here in this cell,

402
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:16,458
and you will be here
watching when she does.

403
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:19,250
You'll be here the rest of your days.

404
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:25,083
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

405
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:28,792
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

406
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:32,083
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

407
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,209
...to bone and dust.

408
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:39,542
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

409
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,249
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

410
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,667
I don't want her to miss a thing.

411
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,918
No.

412
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,167
Don't.

413
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:17,042
What are you doing? No
one can see us like this.

414
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:20,709
I am the Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

415
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,374
Forgive me, Your Grace.

416
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,708
The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

417
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,708
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

418
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,043
At once, Your Grace.

419
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:47,291
No, thank you.

420
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:49,000
My condolences, Your Grace,

421
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,958
on the death of your son.

422
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,666
From all reports, he
was a fine young man.

423
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,416
The Iron Bank didn't send
you here to offer condolences.

424
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,917
Condolences and congratulations.

425
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:02,875
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

426
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:04,875
that's quite an accomplishment.

427
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:08,666
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

428
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,249
freeing the crown from elements

429
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,750
who sought to subvert the rule of law.

430
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:15,917
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

431
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:20,124
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

432
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,500
to restore order and
rational leadership.

433
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:25,249
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

434
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,833
Your father never minced words either.

435
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,666
But, yes, your debts are considerable.

436
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,541
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

437
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,458
We both know how expensive war can be.

438
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,666
And we both know gold wins wars.

439
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,124
Your vaults are empty.

440
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,625
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

441
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,958
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

442
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,541
You are surrounded on all
sides by rivals for the throne.

443
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,500
And the Iron Bank wants
to bet on a winner.

444
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,208
We don't make bets.

445
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,792
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

446
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:00,750
A fancy way of saying "bet."

447
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:04,500
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

448
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:07,500
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

449
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,541
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

450
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,000
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

451
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,500
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

452
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:15,708
For now.

453
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,458
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

454
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:23,792
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

455
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:28,833
Her dragons might not be as
invulnerable as some think.

456
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:31,208
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.

457
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,124
You want to invest in her?

458
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

459
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,750
How are your profits

460
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,291
now that Daenerys has
freed all the slaves?

461
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:46,458
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

462
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,333
From what I gather,
she considers herself

463
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,666
more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

464
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:55,583
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

465
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:58,583
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

466
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,750
but Lannisters always pay their debts.

467
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:05,167
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

468
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,750
Your father's daughter, indeed.

469
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,083
Give me a fortnight.

470
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:14,291
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

471
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,708
And when you return to Braavos,

472
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:20,167
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

473
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:47,626
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

474
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,708
You're making it difficult.

475
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:55,375
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

476
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:59,625
You make me feel like I'm
failing at brooding over failing.

477
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,333
I'm a prisoner on this island.

478
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:05,291
I wouldn't say you're a
prisoner on this island.

479
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,792
You're free to walk the castle,

480
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,708
the beaches, to go wherever you want.

481
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,875
Except to my ship.

482
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:12,291
You took my ship.

483
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,249
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

484
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,750
I'm not playing word games with you.

485
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,625
The dead are coming for us all.

486
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,291
Why don't you figure out what to do

487
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,374
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

488
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,249
and I'll figure out what to
do about your walking dead men.

489
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,458
It's hard for me to
fathom. It really is.

490
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:30,584
If someone told me about the
white walkers and the Night King...

491
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,250
You probably don't believe me.

492
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,875
I do, actually.

493
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,417
You didn't before.

494
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,333
"Grumkins and snarks," you called them.

495
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,416
Do you remember?

496
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,500
You said it was all nonsense.

497
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:56,625
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

498
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,750
But then Mormont saw them

499
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,166
and you saw them.

500
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,833
And I trust the eyes of an honest man

501
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,834
more than I trust what everybody knows.

502
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,416
How do I convince
people who don't know me

503
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:11,166
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

504
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,500
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

505
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm looking for an answer.

506
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:20,958
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

507
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,416
White walkers, the Night King,

508
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,500
Army of the Dead...

509
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,124
it's almost a relief to confront

510
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,001
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

511
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:35,292
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

512
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,334
I can't help them from here.

513
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,084
I'd like to leave.

514
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,042
It seems unlikely that you
became King in the North

515
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,709
by giving up that easily.

516
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:53,000
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

517
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,792
Don't go south.

518
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,458
Don't answer a summons from
the Mad King's daughter,

519
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,876
a foreign invader.

520
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,958
And here I am,

521
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,500
a Northern fool.

522
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,958
Children are not their fathers,

523
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,667
luckily for all of us.

524
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,374
And sometimes there's
more to foreign invaders

525
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,583
and Northern fools than meets the eye.

526
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,792
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

527
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,625
Instead, she stayed where she was

528
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:24,291
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

529
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:26,625
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

530
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,208
While you're our guest here,

531
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,750
you might consider asking them

532
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:32,500
what they think of the
Mad King's daughter.

533
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:35,583
She protects people from monsters,

534
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,124
just as you do.

535
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,583
It's why she came here.

536
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,124
And she's not about to head north

537
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,583
to fight an enemy she's never seen

538
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:45,083
on the word of a man she doesn't know.

539
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:47,500
After a single meeting,

540
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:50,292
it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

541
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,918
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

542
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:04,917
What do you mean?

543
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:07,166
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

544
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,834
I'm asking if there's
something I can do to help you.

545
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,333
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

546
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,792
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

547
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,792
He says you have a
tremendous amount of it here.

548
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,583
Why are we talking about glass?

549
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:23,458
We just lost two of our allies.

550
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,834
Which is why I was speaking
to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

551
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:32,958
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

552
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,291
Apparently, it can
be turned into weapons

553
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,416
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

554
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,583
Or stop them.

555
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:41,875
Destroy them.

556
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,501
Unsure about the nomenclature.

557
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,416
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

558
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,291
and white walkers and Night Kings?

559
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,917
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

560
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:57,166
But a wise man once said that
you should never believe a thing

561
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,709
simply because you want to believe it.

562
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:05,583
Which wise man said this?

563
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,458
I don't remember.

564
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,876
Are you trying to present your
own statements as ancient wisdom?

565
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:14,291
I would never do that.

566
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,334
To you.

567
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,833
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

568
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,249
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

569
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,333
I would have told him not to come.

570
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,666
And he's here anyway.

571
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,083
You don't have to believe him.

572
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,124
Let him mine the dragonglass.

573
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,750
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

574
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,833
You didn't even know it was here.

575
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:38,374
It's nothing to you.

576
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:41,666
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

577
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,374
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

578
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,958
with a possible ally.

579
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:50,333
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand...

580
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,709
Casterly Rock.

581
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,750
What was that Ser Davos said

582
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,792
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

583
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,583
Did you notice that?

584
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:03,042
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

585
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,209
It's dreary in the North.

586
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,584
Amazing thing to see.

587
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:27,125
I named them for my
brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

588
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,751
They're both gone now.

589
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,417
You lost two brothers as well.

590
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:39,459
People thought dragons were
gone forever, but here they are.

591
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:44,043
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

592
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,291
You've been talking to Tyrion.

593
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,042
He is my Hand.

594
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,667
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

595
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,626
I don't.

596
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,625
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

597
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,792
I never expected that you would.

598
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:11,042
And I haven't changed my mind

599
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,124
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

600
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,959
I haven't either.

601
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:28,500
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

602
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,501
Any resources or men you
need, I will provide for you.

603
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,001
Thank you.

604
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:46,167
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

605
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,043
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

606
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,333
How much do we have?

607
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,416
4,000 bushels, my lady.

608
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,583
What does that mean?

609
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:23,666
For the current occupants of the castle,

610
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,333
it's enough food for
a year, perhaps more.

611
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:30,750
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

612
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,208
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

613
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,042
I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.

614
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:38,541
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

615
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:40,666
You're telling me we
don't have enough food,

616
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:43,876
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

617
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,374
No, my lady, most likely not.

618
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,500
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

619
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,583
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

620
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,875
this is the best place to be.

621
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:55,833
We need to start building
up our grain stores

622
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:58,416
with regular shipments from
every keep in the North.

623
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,708
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

624
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,042
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

625
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,750
they won't have enough time to
bring wagonloads of grain with them.

626
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,166
Very wise, my lady.

627
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,959
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

628
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,249
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

629
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,625
No, my lady.

630
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,708
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

631
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,124
They should, indeed.

632
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,333
Pardon me, my lady.

633
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,918
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

634
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,709
Command suits you.

635
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:34,500
The Northerners are all facing north,

636
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,583
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

637
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,124
So they should be.

638
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,792
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

639
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,875
If you turn your back on her...

640
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,444
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

641
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,274
I only meant to say...

642
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:50,333
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

643
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:52,417
Thank you for your wise counsel.

644
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,917
One of two things will happen...

645
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:58,208
either the dead will defeat the living,

646
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,166
in which case...

647
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,249
all our troubles come to an end,

648
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,625
or life will win out.

649
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,625
And what then?

650
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:10,626
Don't fight in the North or the South.

651
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:17,084
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

652
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:20,875
Everyone is your enemy,

653
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,792
everyone is your friend...

654
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,917
every possible series of
events is happening all at once.

655
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:31,500
Live that way and
nothing will surprise you.

656
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:34,083
Everything that happens
will be something

657
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,001
that you've seen before.

658
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,001
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

659
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,709
Hello, Sansa.

660
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,708
I wish Jon were here.

661
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:40,584
Yes, I need to speak to him.

662
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,375
You're Father's last
living trueborn son.

663
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,083
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

664
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:55,333
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

665
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:57,166
I can never be lord of anything.

666
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,417
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

667
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:02,291
I don't know what that means.

668
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:04,708
It's difficult to explain.

669
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,918
Try. Please, for me.

670
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:11,583
It means I can see everything.

671
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:13,917
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

672
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,917
Everything that's happening right now.

673
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:21,708
It's all pieces now, fragments.

674
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,917
I need to learn to see better.

675
00:44:23,918 --> 00:44:27,333
When the Long Night comes again,

676
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,959
I need to be ready.

677
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:34,416
How do you know all this?

678
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:35,958
The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.

679
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,875
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

680
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,625
I told you it's difficult to explain.

681
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:44,291
Bran...

682
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:46,666
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

683
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:50,667
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

684
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,959
It was so beautiful that night.

685
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:03,959
Snow falling, just like now.

686
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:09,043
And you were so beautiful...

687
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,793
in your white wedding dress.

688
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,542
I have to go back inside, Bran.

689
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,626
I'll stay a bit longer.

690
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:36,876
Hmm.

691
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,209
Hmm.

692
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,541
Does it hurt?

693
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:57,250
A bit. Less than before.

694
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:01,666
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

695
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,083
Unusual.

696
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:06,541
Unlikely.

697
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,541
One could almost be forgiven

698
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:12,124
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

699
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:16,500
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

700
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,792
Don't know anything about that.

701
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,875
I just started feeling better.

702
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:25,542
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

703
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:30,124
And the climate.

704
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,083
The climate.

705
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,875
You're free to go, ser.

706
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,917
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

707
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,625
which you are no longer.

708
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,125
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

709
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:45,375
How bad is it?

710
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,417
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

711
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:56,249
Where will you go?

712
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,959
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

713
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,249
I knew it would kill me

714
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,917
or I'd kill myself before it could.

715
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:10,166
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

716
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,792
The only place for me is back with her.

717
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:16,208
I owe her my life.

718
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,792
Her and you.

719
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,333
Your father saved me more than once.

720
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,125
It's the least I could do.

721
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:30,000
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

722
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,417
I hope they do.

723
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,000
- You treated him?
- Yes.

724
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,500
Who told you to treat him?

725
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:05,833
No one.

726
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:09,124
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

727
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,833
I seem to remember you.

728
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,667
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

729
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:19,458
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

730
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,792
especially on someone of that age.

731
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:24,000
You could have infected
yourself and others.

732
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:27,459
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

733
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:31,666
But you didn't.

734
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,291
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

735
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:37,708
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

736
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,166
have attempted it and failed.

737
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,249
Yet you succeeded.

738
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,375
How?

739
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:48,667
I read the books and
followed the instructions.

740
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:01,250
That man is alive because of you.

741
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,167
You should be proud.

742
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,750
Thank you, Archmaester.

743
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,751
Come here.

744
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:19,374
All these manuscripts and
scrolls are rotting away.

745
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,043
I need you to make copies of them.

746
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:28,417
You were expecting a reward.

747
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,918
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

748
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:37,083
You'd better get started.

749
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:38,750
And careful of the paper mites.

750
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:40,084
They like flesh as well.

751
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:50,708
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

752
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:54,208
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

753
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:55,750
To send our remaining ships after him...

754
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:58,417
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

755
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,792
Would you have to go yourself?

756
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,792
Euron's ships could be anywhere

757
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,792
or in more than one place.

758
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:10,208
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

759
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,249
for who knows how long.

760
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,875
I wouldn't be alone.

761
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,458
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

762
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,249
What can anyone do to them?

763
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,249
They can still do something to you.

764
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,042
It only takes one arrow.

765
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:23,584
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

766
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:28,042
What about Casterly Rock?

767
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,000
The Unsullied will be there soon.

768
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:32,583
And what will they face?

769
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,000
A difficult situation.

770
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,124
They know we're coming.

771
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,458
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

772
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:42,083
is to destroy House Lannister.

773
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,834
She will be ready.

774
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:50,458
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Archers!

775
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:52,833
The Lannister Army is still
the army my father built.

776
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:55,166
- Come on!
- Well-trained and well-provisioned.

777
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,958
10,000 men at least.

778
00:50:56,959 --> 00:50:57,959
They will see us coming.

779
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,166
They will be ready.

780
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:09,501
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

781
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:14,834
The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

782
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,792
The fight up the walls will be hard.

783
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,334
We will be at a disadvantage.

784
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,375
Many men will die.

785
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,584
Just as my father said they would.

786
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,374
Interesting thing about my father...

787
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,291
he built our house up from near ruin.

788
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:44,458
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

789
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:46,541
but he didn't build the sewers.

790
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,625
That was beneath him,

791
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:51,500
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find...

792
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,042
me.

793
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,875
He was right, I was low.

794
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:57,000
The company I kept, low.

795
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,541
Women, mostly.

796
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,208
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

797
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,500
Father disapproved of
that sort of behavior.

798
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:04,124
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

799
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,583
I couldn't have them in my chambers,

800
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,833
so in the process of
building the sewers,

801
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,584
I threw in something for myself.

802
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,625
It was a passage that began

803
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:16,333
in an out of the way cove by the sea

804
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:19,750
and ended beneath one
of the main guard towers.

805
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:22,959
No better place for low
pursuits than beneath the ground.

806
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:28,333
Casterly Rock is an
impregnable fortress.

807
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:34,249
But as a good friend of mine once said,

808
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,208
"Give me 10 good men and
I'll impregnate the bitch."

809
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:44,959
And so it begins.

810
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,583
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

811
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:56,458
They will be outnumbered.

812
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:58,793
They will have less
armor and fewer weapons.

813
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:07,541
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

814
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:10,500
The Unsullied will be
fighting for something greater.

815
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,500
They will be fighting for freedom

816
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,291
and the person who gave it to them.

817
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,792
They will be fighting for you.

818
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,250
And that is why they will triumph.

819
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,001
_

820
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:40,667
_

821
00:53:41,853 --> 00:53:43,472
_

822
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:07,208
Where are they?!

823
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,834
Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

824
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,959
- It's done.
- It is.

825
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:46,959
And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

826
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:50,750
Did we fight well?

827
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,792
Uh, as well as could be expected.

828
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:55,917
It was never our forte.

829
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,001
Golden roses, indeed.

830
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:01,958
Your brother and his new queen

831
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,875
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

832
00:56:04,876 --> 00:56:08,166
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

833
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,750
Well, it is to me,

834
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:12,083
but my fond childhood memories

835
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,625
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

836
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:15,750
So you just let them take it?

837
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:17,792
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

838
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:20,333
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,

839
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,333
we emptied the larders before we left.

840
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:24,583
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

841
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:28,000
and march all the way across Westeros.

842
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,166
And you took your army, your real army,

843
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,042
and went where they weren't.

844
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:36,374
As Robb Stark did to
me at Whispering Wood.

845
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,416
There are always lessons in failures.

846
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:42,001
Yes. You must be very wise by now.

847
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:46,166
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

848
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:47,917
If he was so clever,

849
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,666
why didn't he take Highgarden

850
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:53,374
the moment your gold mines ran dry?

851
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:58,833
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

852
00:56:58,834 --> 00:57:01,918
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

853
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,875
How will you do it?

854
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,333
With that sword?

855
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,708
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

856
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:14,042
Not that he ever used it.

857
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:15,709
What did he call it?

858
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,666
Widow's Wail.

859
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,876
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

860
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:28,875
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

861
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:32,917
Or watched them being done on my orders.

862
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:36,083
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

863
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:38,124
They were necessary.

864
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,166
And whatever I imagined necessary

865
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:44,083
for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

866
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:48,709
But your sister has done things...

867
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,708
I was incapable of imagining.

868
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:55,541
That was my prize mistake...

869
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,084
a failure of imagination.

870
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,875
She's a monster, you do know that?

871
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,042
To you, I'm sure.

872
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:05,917
To others as well.

873
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:09,416
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

874
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:13,750
when people are living
peacefully in the world she built,

875
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:17,459
do you really think they'll wring
their hands over the way she built it?

876
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:22,083
You love her.

877
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:23,875
You really do love her.

878
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,333
You poor fool.

879
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:28,083
She'll be the end of you.

880
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,625
Possibly.

881
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:32,416
Not much to be gained

882
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,458
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

883
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:37,166
What better person to discuss it with?

884
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,083
What better guarantee could you have

885
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:43,124
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

886
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,166
But perhaps you're right.

887
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,750
If she's driven you this far,

888
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:50,167
it's gone beyond your control.

889
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,458
Yes.

890
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:54,918
It has.

891
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,042
She's a disease.

892
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:01,000
I regret my role in spreading it.

893
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:02,583
You will, too.

894
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,334
I think we're done here.

895
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,793
How will it happen?

896
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,249
Cersei had several ideas.

897
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,666
Whipping you through the streets

898
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:16,333
and beheading you in
front of the Red Keep.

899
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:20,167
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

900
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,125
I talked her out of those.

901
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,792
Will there be pain?

902
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,374
No. I made sure of that.

903
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,709
That's good.

904
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:02,501
I'd hate to die like your son.

905
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,166
Clawing at my neck,

906
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,042
foam and bile spilling from my mouth,

907
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:11,875
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

908
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:14,249
Must have been horrible for you,

909
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,708
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

910
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:20,291
It was horrible enough for me.

911
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,958
A shocking scene.

912
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:25,751
Not at all what I intended.

913
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:32,292
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

914
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,416
Tell Cersei.

915
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:41,876
I want her to know it was me.

916
01:00:57,497 --> 01:01:08,125
