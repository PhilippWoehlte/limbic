3
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,340
Hold that wagon!

4
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,757
You've just won
the biggest prize in the world.

5
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,007
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

6
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,215
Come on,
you can tell me.

7
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,757
Queen of Thorns
give you one last prick in the balls

8
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:40,090
before saying goodbye?

9
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,674
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

10
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,882
There is no more
High Septon.

11
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,132
No, there isn't,
is there?

12
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,424
There is still
the question of my prize.

13
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:55,090
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

14
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,424
It's not a castle.

15
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,257
How about that one?
It's available.

16
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,632
You don't want
Highgarden.

17
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,424
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

18
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,632
Daenerys Targaryen could come and
take it back the day after you move in.

19
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,882
Besides,
think of the upkeep.

20
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,923
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

21
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,507
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

22
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,424
All your new riches
weighing you down?

23
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,965
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

24
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,716
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

25
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,965
See?
We pay our debts.

26
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,799
Right,
just not to me.

27
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,465
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

28
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,923
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

29
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,841
with a saddlebag
full of gold,

30
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,299
complaining about
not getting paid.

31
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,090
When we win this war,

32
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,965
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

33
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,424
will be yours
to choose from,

34
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,841
with no one left
to take them away from you.

35
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,716
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

36
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,173
will be quiet
and peaceable.

37
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,757
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

38
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:53,799
Like what?

39
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,799
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

40
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,632
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

41
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,299
from all the farms
in the Reach.

42
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,632
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

43
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,799
and help them
accelerate this process?

44
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,799
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

45
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,965
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to
hand over their harvest...

46
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,007
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

47
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,841
My lord.

48
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,965
My lord.

49
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,173
My lord.

50
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,090
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

51
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,841
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

52
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:47,048
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

53
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:50,674
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

54
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,882
You're too kind,
my lord.

55
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:56,048
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

56
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:59,215
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

57
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,965
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

58
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,048
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

59
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,340
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

60
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,340
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

61
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,257
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

62
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:19,007
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

63
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:22,257
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

64
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,716
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

65
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:27,507
in some
current venture.

66
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,465
My only venture
at this moment

67
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,132
is reestablishing control
over this continent

68
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,424
and every person on it.

69
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:37,257
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

70
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:41,215
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

71
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,465
It will, indeed.

72
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:45,424
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

73
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:49,132
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

74
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,340
I know them well.

75
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,799
They have helped us
recover significant sums

76
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,757
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

77
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:57,465
That's good to hear.

78
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,882
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

79
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,591
Rest assured,
Your Grace,

80
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:07,507
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

81
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,549
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

82
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,632
This is for you.

83
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,132
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

84
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,965
but your mother
fought him off.

85
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,799
The other dagger,

86
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,465
the one that
took her life,

87
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,674
I would have stopped that dagger
with my own heart

88
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,090
if I could have.

89
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,799
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

90
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:52,507
But I am here
for her now

91
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:55,215
to do what she
would have done,

92
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,173
to protect
her children.

93
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:03,674
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

94
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,007
you need only ask.

95
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,215
Do you know
who this belonged to?

96
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,923
No.

97
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,757
That very question was
what started the War of the Five Kings.

98
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:22,173
In a way, that dagger made you
what you are today.

99
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,048
Forced from your home,

100
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,549
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

101
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:31,299
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

102
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:43,882
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

103
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:48,507
only to find such chaos
in the world,

104
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:49,549
I can only imagine...

105
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,507
Chaos is a ladder.

106
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,799
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

107
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,215
I'm not Lord Stark.

108
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,716
What's that?

109
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,716
Maester Wolkan
built it for me

110
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,257
so I can move around
more easily.

111
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,090
It's a very good idea.

112
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,799
You're leaving.

113
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,757
I don't want
to leave you,

114
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,757
but when...
when they come,

115
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:39,465
I need to be
with my family.

116
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,549
And you're safe.

117
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,424
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

118
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:47,757
You don't
need me anymore.

119
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,382
No, I don't.

120
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:55,961
That's all
you've got to say?

121
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,007
Thank you.

122
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,465
Thank you?

123
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,132
For helping me.

124
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,257
My brother
died for you.

125
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,965
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

126
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,299
I almost died for you.

127
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:20,132
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

128
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,632
Not anymore.

129
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,090
I remember what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark,

130
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,591
but I remember
so much else now.

131
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,299
You died in that cave.

132
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,090
I did.

133
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,507
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

134
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:28,173
The only thing in the kitchen
that you've put your cock in is the liver.

135
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,507
'Ey up.
Where you going?

136
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,048
In there.
I live here.

137
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,757
Fuck off.

138
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,841
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

139
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,340
Arya Stark's dead.

140
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,173
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

141
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:51,215
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

142
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,048
Maester's named Wolkan.

143
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:56,215
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

144
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:58,757
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

145
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,549
Look, it's cold
and we're busy,

146
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,923
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

147
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:07,799
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

148
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,965
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

149
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,674
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

150
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,424
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

151
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:22,257
Tell Sansa
her sister's home.

152
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:26,591
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you, just like us.

153
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,923
So, for the last time,
fuck off.

154
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,048
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

155
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:40,549
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

156
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,591
But if I am and Sansa finds out
you turned me away...

157
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,799
Right, you sit there.

158
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,007
Right there.

159
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,007
Don't move.

160
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,965
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

161
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:05,299
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

162
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,674
Why me?

163
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,923
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

164
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:36,841
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
you right in the fucking face

165
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,215
as hard as I can.

166
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,965
We told her to wait.

167
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:50,716
We were standing
right next to her, and...

168
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,841
And... and when we turned around,
she'd gone, my lady.

169
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,716
She... she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

170
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:57,507
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

171
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:00,007
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

172
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,424
And don't trouble
yourself over it, my lady.

173
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:05,632
- We'll... we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

174
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,132
I know where she is.

175
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,674
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

176
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,382
Yes.

177
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,799
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

178
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,841
I didn't run.

179
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:52,215
You need better guards.

180
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,048
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

181
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,090
Jon left you
in charge?

182
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,465
He did.

183
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,382
I hope
he comes back soon.

184
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,215
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

185
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:15,549
When he sees you,
his heart will probably stop.

186
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,632
It doesn't look
like him.

187
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,923
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

188
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,923
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

189
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,424
We're not.

190
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,173
They say
you killed Joffrey.

191
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,465
Did you?

192
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,132
I wish I had.

193
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:52,173
Hmm.
Me, too.

194
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,799
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

195
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,465
However long my list got,
he was always first.

196
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,382
Your list?

197
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,591
Of people
I'm going to kill.

198
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,215
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

199
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,048
It's a long story.

200
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,132
I imagine
yours is, too.

201
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,090
Yes.

202
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,215
Not a very
pleasant one.

203
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,215
Mine neither.

204
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,965
But our stories
aren't over yet.

205
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,841
No, they're not.

206
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,340
Arya...

207
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,048
Bran's home, too.

208
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,716
You came home.

209
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:43,591
I saw you
at the crossroads.

210
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,757
You saw me?

211
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,257
I see quite a lot now.

212
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:54,090
Bran has... visions.

213
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,257
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

214
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,507
So did I.

215
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:00,382
Why would you
go back there?

216
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,965
Cersei's on
her list of names.

217
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:16,382
Who else
is on your list?

218
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,132
Most of them
are dead already.

219
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,591
Where did
you get this?

220
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,007
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

221
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,549
Littlefinger?
He's here?

222
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,424
He has declared
for House Stark.

223
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,299
Why would he
give you a dagger?

224
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,799
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

225
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,507
Because it was
meant to kill me.

226
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:49,382
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

227
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:52,257
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

228
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:55,299
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

229
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,465
He's not
a generous man.

230
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,841
He wouldn't
give you anything

231
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,757
unless he thought
he was getting something back.

232
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,132
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

233
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,048
I don't want it.

234
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,382
Are you sure?

235
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,090
It's Valyrian steel.

236
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,465
It's wasted
on a cripple.

237
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,757
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

238
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:59,132
You kept your vow.

239
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:00,549
I did
next to nothing.

240
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:02,465
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

241
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,048
I'm not a...

242
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,841
Thank you, Podrick.

243
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:30,090
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

244
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,757
Soon.

245
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,591
He will
come back to you.

246
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,799
He'd better.

247
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,757
What happened?

248
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,090
Many things.

249
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:47,632
Many things?

250
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,215
Your Grace.

251
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:20,549
I wanted you
to see it

252
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,299
before we start
hacking it to bits.

253
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,215
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

254
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:12,716
There is something else
I want to show you, Your Grace.

255
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,923
The children
of the forest made these.

256
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,757
When?

257
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:49,549
A very long time ago.

258
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:55,173
They were right here,

259
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:57,591
standing where
we're standing.

260
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:02,757
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

261
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,841
Maybe even before
there were men.

262
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:07,173
No.

263
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:22,424
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

264
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,632
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

265
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:40,215
They fought together
against their common enemy.

266
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:44,090
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

267
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:47,257
Together.

268
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,173
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

269
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,007
Because the enemy
is real.

270
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:01,257
It's always been real.

271
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,549
And you say
you can't defeat them

272
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,465
without my armies
and my dragons?

273
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:20,090
No, I don't think I can.

274
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,591
I will fight for you.

275
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:32,465
I will fight
for the North.

276
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,716
When you
bend the knee.

277
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,882
My people...

278
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,591
won't accept
a southern ruler.

279
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:52,132
Not after everything
they've suffered.

280
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:58,173
They will
if their king does.

281
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,841
They chose you
to lead them.

282
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,007
They chose you
to protect them.

283
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:09,841
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

284
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,299
What is it?

285
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,048
We took
Casterly Rock.

286
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,048
That's very good
to hear.

287
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,716
Isn't it?

288
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,048
You'll want to discuss this
amongst yourselves.

289
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:54,716
- Perhaps...
- You will stay.

290
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,799
All my allies are gone.

291
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,215
They've been taken from me
while I've been sitting here on this island.

292
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,757
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

293
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:04,841
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

294
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,841
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

295
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,632
We still have enough ships
to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

296
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,882
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

297
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,485
We have a plan.
It's still the right plan.

298
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,922
The right plan!

299
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:19,716
Your strategy has lost us
Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

300
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:23,132
- If I have underestimated our enemies...
- Our enemies?

301
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:25,382
Your family, you mean.

302
00:25:25,382 --> 00:25:28,257
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

303
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:39,173
Enough with
the clever plans.

304
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,841
I have three
large dragons.

305
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,549
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

306
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,882
We've discussed this.

307
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:47,132
My enemies
are in the Red Keep.

308
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:50,507
What kind of a queen am I if I'm
not willing to risk my life to fight them?

309
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,257
A smart one.

310
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,632
What do you think
I should do?

311
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,215
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

312
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:04,257
I'm losing.

313
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:07,799
What do you think
I should do?

314
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:16,841
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

315
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,841
No one did.

316
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,965
The people
who follow you

317
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:25,132
know that you made
something impossible happen.

318
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,007
Maybe that
helps them believe

319
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:31,173
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

320
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,132
Build a world
that's different

321
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:35,549
from the shit one
they've always known.

322
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,173
But if you use them
to melt castles and burn cities,

323
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,799
you're not different.

324
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:47,507
You're just
more of the same.

325
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,007
Don't lunge.

326
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,841
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

327
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,882
Up.

328
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:27,638
And don't...

329
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,585
Don't fight someone like her
in the first place.

330
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,048
Nice sword.

331
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,674
Very nice dagger.

332
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:51,007
If they haven't contributed
the right amount of grain to the stores,

333
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,424
then I'm afraid they'll have to make due
with what they've brought.

334
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:54,716
We can't...

335
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:00,591
It's been a while
since I trained.

336
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:03,215
I can go and find
the master of arms for you, my lady.

337
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,090
He didn't beat
the Hound.

338
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,132
You did.

339
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:09,632
I want to train
with you.

340
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:15,007
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

341
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,132
didn't you?

342
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,424
Move aside, Podrick.

343
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,382
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

344
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,591
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

345
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,965
I'll try not to.

346
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,549
Who taught you
how to do that?

347
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:57,215
No one.

348
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:34,507
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

349
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:38,965
I believe you know
of whom I speak.

350
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:41,299
I think she has
a good heart.

351
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,090
A good heart?

352
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,757
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

353
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,591
There's no time
for that.

354
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:51,424
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

355
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:55,340
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

356
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,882
10,000? Less?

357
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:59,007
- Fewer.
- What?

358
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:02,549
Speaking of good hearts...
Missandei of Naath.

359
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:06,549
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

360
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:08,090
King Snow, isn't it?

361
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,465
No, that doesn't
sound right.

362
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,340
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

363
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,173
Forgive me,
but may I ask a question?

364
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,132
Of course.

365
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:20,007
Your name is Jon Snow,
but your father's name was Ned Stark?

366
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,173
I'm a bastard.

367
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,132
My mother and father
weren't married.

368
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,090
Is the custom
different in Naath?

369
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,007
We don't have
marriage in Naath,

370
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,965
so the concept
of a bastard doesn't exist.

371
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:36,465
That sounds...
liberating.

372
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,674
Why did you leave
your homeland?

373
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:43,299
I was stolen away
by slavers.

374
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,799
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,923
If I may,
how did a slave girl

376
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:50,173
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

377
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:54,048
She bought me from my master
and set me free.

378
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:55,841
That was good of her.

379
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:59,799
Of course, you're
serving her now, aren't you?

380
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,965
I serve my queen
because I want to serve my queen.

381
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,716
Because
I believe in her.

382
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,674
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

383
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:12,007
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

384
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:14,173
You believe that?

385
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,007
I know it.

386
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:20,007
All of us
who came with her from Essos,

387
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,716
we believe in her.

388
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,382
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

389
00:32:24,382 --> 00:32:27,507
of some king
we never knew.

390
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:30,299
She's the queen
we chose.

391
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:34,173
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

392
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,340
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

393
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:00,215
Halt!

394
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:26,424
Jon.

395
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,923
I didn't know
you were here.

396
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,257
S-Sansa...

397
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:44,257
is she all right?

398
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,424
What you did for her...

399
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:50,757
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

400
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:01,799
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

401
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,632
We thought
you were dead.

402
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:06,257
I should be.

403
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:07,632
Your sister?

404
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,757
Euron has her.

405
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:14,465
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

406
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:18,757
The queen is gone.

407
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:23,090
Where did she go?

408
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,674
Get the horses watered!

409
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:45,340
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

410
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,507
Good.

411
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:47,841
We need to get
the last of these wagons

412
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:49,923
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

413
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,632
The head of the line
is ambushed,

414
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,923
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

415
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,549
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

416
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:57,007
With your permission,

417
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:00,173
flogging stragglers
has a marked effect on mobility.

418
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,632
Let's give them
fair warning first.

419
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,549
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

420
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,923
Now, get it on this thing.

421
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:22,173
Lift!

422
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,173
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

423
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:28,591
Dickon.

424
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,674
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

425
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,882
Your first battle?

426
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:40,090
And?

427
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,340
It was glorious.

428
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,882
Come on,
your father's not here.

429
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:48,299
All my life, we've been pledged
to House Tyrell.

430
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:51,549
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

431
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,299
They didn't
deserve to die.

432
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:56,465
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

433
00:35:56,465 --> 00:35:58,591
and support
the Targaryen girl.

434
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:01,549
So here we are.

435
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,716
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

436
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,799
Men shit themselves
when they die.

437
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,882
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

438
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:11,923
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

439
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:21,132
What?

440
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:23,090
Listen.

441
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,549
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

442
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:40,090
- What is it?
- Get in line!

443
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,090
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

444
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,591
Get in line now!

445
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:49,799
Form up!
Come on, lads!

446
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:51,382
Guard those wagons!

447
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:53,841
Form a line!
Form a line!

448
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,965
Round those spears!

449
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,965
Shield wall!

450
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:10,965
Fill the gaps!

451
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:14,299
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

452
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,340
- Archers!
- Look alive!

453
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,132
Get tight!

454
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,965
Get in line, boys!

455
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:22,382
- Ready!
- Here they come!

456
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:49,716
Courage, lads!
Courage!

457
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:52,632
Wait! Wait for it!

458
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:54,799
Spears out!

459
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:02,382
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

460
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,674
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

461
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:17,007
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

462
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,048
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

463
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,215
We can hold them off.

464
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:41,716
Dracarys!

465
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,882
Hold the line!

466
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,257
Hold!

467
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:26,799
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

468
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:33,132
Throw it!

469
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,424
Hold!

470
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,299
Draw!

471
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,299
Loose!

472
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:39,424
- Archers!
- Archers!

473
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,173
Archers, with me!

474
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:44,132
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

475
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,507
- Nock!
- Nock!

476
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:54,007
Draw!

477
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:04,716
- Loose!
- Loose!

478
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:13,048
Run!

479
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,173
Qyburn's scorpion
is over there.

480
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:27,215
Go get it, then.

00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,716
I can't shoot
