1
00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:02,386
<i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,491
we are the free and independent
Kingdom of the North."

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,521
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:09,827
I will, Your Grace.

5
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:11,729
Did you see my brother when you
were the Starks' guest?

6
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,825
I did.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,509
Tell him he's not
been forgotten.

8
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:21,973
I'll do it.

9
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,675
Come, brothers.
We'll leave him to it.

10
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,510
Be quick about it.

11
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:30,316
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,418
All of you should do
as he commands.

13
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:34,553
Betray me and you will
wish you hadn't.

14
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:35,921
<i>All hail the king.</i>

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,591
Who threw that?

16
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:42,994
Get back!

17
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,568
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

18
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,337
Your brothers desert you?

19
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:54,972
- We'll stop here.
- Think they're out looking for you?

20
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,274
Yes.

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,780
What might this be?
Let's go.

22
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,183
Amory Lorch.
Now!

23
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:07,252
A man will do
what must be done.

24
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,824
<i>Guard!</i>

25
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,260
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

26
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,568
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

27
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:25,504
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth

28
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,339
with no regrets.

29
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:32,511
Where are they?
Where are my dragons?!

30
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,161
A cripple?

31
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,064
You let a cripple escape?

32
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,929
<i>The boy can't walk,</i>

33
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,935
but somehow
he slipped past you?

34
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,572
The giant must have
took him.

35
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,874
The giant?

36
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:03,411
Hodor?

37
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:06,047
Oh, well,
that's all right, then.

38
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:09,550
You let a halfwit
escape with a cripple.

39
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,485
And Rickon, too?
The little one?

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,055
Gone along with
the wildling woman,

41
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,658
the one you were fucking.

42
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:40,880
Right, get the horses
and the hounds.

43
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,551
Come on, find the scent.

44
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,559
Come on,
where they going?

45
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,602
Halt!

46
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,342
Enjoying
your first hunt?

47
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,578
So far, hunting seems very similar
to riding, My Lord.

48
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,081
With hunting,
there's blood at the end.

49
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,048
They're little boys.

50
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,497
I was a little boy
when I was torn away from

51
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:19,451
my home and brought here.

52
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,052
So I kept my word.

53
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,021
I never ran away.

54
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,158
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

55
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,229
Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

56
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,299
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

57
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,334
They have no value
to me missing.

58
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,904
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

59
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,141
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

60
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,877
<i>She'll get here</i>
<i>long before they do.</i>

61
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,561
And Ned Stark always
said 500 men could hold

62
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,181
Winterfell against 10,000.

63
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,117
<i>We have a scent!</i>

64
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,752
The hounds have the scent.

65
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,288
Come, Maester,
don't look so grim.

66
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,090
It's all just a game.

67
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,174
We should have
took more food.

68
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,343
We couldn't risk
going to the kitchens.

69
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,845
Those people
all love you.

70
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,280
They would have given
you whatever you needed.

71
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,149
And if Theon found out,
he'd hang them.

72
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,151
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

73
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,455
We've been walking
since before sunrise.

74
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,924
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

75
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,927
- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

76
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,733
Wait, I know that farm.

77
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,568
<i>I sent those two</i>
<i>Winterfell orphans there.</i>

78
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,537
Jack and Billy.

79
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,305
They'll give us some food.

80
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,406
We can't risk it.

81
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,108
If Theon tracks us here,
he'll torture them

82
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:53,110
until he finds out
where we are.

83
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,546
Billy climbs a tree
better than anyone.

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,314
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

85
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,850
<i>They'll be after us</i>
<i>with hounds.</i>

86
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,452
<i>We got a good start</i>
<i>on them,</i>

87
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:03,921
but we can't outrun
hounds forever.

88
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,050
Did you pull a knife
on me in the night?

89
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:43,760
What's the matter?

90
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,662
Can't be the first time
you pressed your bone

91
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,297
against a woman's ass.

92
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,267
Let's move.

93
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,442
Oh, it is
the first time.

94
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:02,679
How old are you, boy?

95
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:05,482
I'm a man
of the Night's Watch.

96
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,087
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

97
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,493
Don't your stones
start to hurt

98
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,096
if your bone
never gets--

99
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,231
Don't call them that.

100
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,568
What, stones?

101
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,270
Or bone?

102
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,706
Neither.

103
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,041
Both.

104
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,611
Move!

105
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,418
Ygritte: I heard they get
all swollen

106
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,787
and bruised if you
don't use them.

107
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,589
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

108
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:47,258
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

109
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,627
As if I'd feel
sorry for them.

110
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,231
Are there
no girl crows?

111
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,034
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

112
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,136
So the lads just do it
with each other?

113
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,038
No.

114
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,573
- Never?
- Never.

115
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:06,176
We swore an oath.

116
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,512
You have sheep
at the Wall?

117
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:12,716
With your hands, then?

118
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,887
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

119
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,389
Would you please shut up?

120
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,558
Would you please shut up?

121
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,128
You think you're
better than me, crow.

122
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,697
- I'm a free woman--
- You're a free woman?

123
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,000
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

124
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,968
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

125
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,603
That's what
"prisoner" means.

126
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,705
And you think you're free?

127
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,708
You swore
some stupid oath

128
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,210
and now you can never
touch a girl.

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,712
It was my choice
to say the words.

130
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,614
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

131
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,616
But you chose
never to touch them.

132
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,353
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

133
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,221
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

134
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,790
you'd prefer
to invade our lands--

135
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,491
Invade your lands?

136
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,460
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

137
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:57,397
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

138
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,400
They're not your lands!

139
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,469
We've been here
the whole time.

140
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,394
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

141
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,073
and said it was yours.

142
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,709
My father was Ned Stark.

143
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:09,711
I have the blood
of the First Men.

144
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:12,981
My ancestors lived here,
same as yours.

145
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,419
So why are you
fighting us?

146
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:35,573
Go on.

147
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:43,148
Now I want you
to tell me what happened.

148
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:46,385
<i>Come on, this way.</i>

149
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:50,021
<i>Come on, speak up.</i>
<i>Speak up.</i>

150
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,961
Wolfsbane--

151
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:00,564
a rare substance.

152
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:03,032
This is no common assassin.

153
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,201
We hanged 20 men
last night.

154
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:08,037
I don't care
if you hanged 100.

155
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,572
A man tried to kill me.

156
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,641
I want his name
and I want his head.

157
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,143
<i>We think it was</i>
<i>an infiltrator</i>

158
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:16,013
from the Brotherhood
Without Banners.

159
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,816
Pretentious name
for a band of outlaws.

160
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,418
We can't allow rebels
behind our lines

161
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,521
to harass us
with impunity.

162
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:25,656
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

163
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,424
<i>That's how kings fall.</i>

164
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,627
I want them dead,
every one.

165
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,428
Killing them
isn't the problem.

166
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:33,398
<i>It's finding them.</i>

167
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,700
Have you gone soft,
Clegane?

168
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,835
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

169
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,472
Burn the villages,
burn the farms.

170
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,875
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

171
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,343
Mmm.

172
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,048
Is that mutton?

173
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:51,583
Yes, My Lord.

174
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:53,185
Don't like mutton.

175
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,154
I'll bring
something else.

176
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:58,290
Leave it.

177
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,826
- Are you hungry?
- No.

178
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,494
Of course you are.

179
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,062
Eat.

180
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:08,332
I'll eat
in the kitchen later.

181
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:12,536
It's bad manners
to refuse a Lord's offer.

182
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,672
Sit.

183
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,241
Eat.

184
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,778
You're small for your age.

185
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,415
I suppose you've been
underfed your whole life.

186
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,150
I eat a lot.

187
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:30,354
- <i>I just don't grow.</i>
- Hmm.

188
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:37,562
This will be my last war,

189
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,731
win or lose.

190
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,835
Have you ever
lost before?

191
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:45,872
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

192
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,550
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

193
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:59,220
<i>The "War of Five Kings"</i>
<i>they're calling it.</i>

194
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:03,792
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

195
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:08,230
Do you know
what legacy means?

196
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,801
It's what you pass down
to your children

197
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,204
and your children's
children.

198
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:19,274
It's what remains of you
when you're gone.

199
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,181
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

200
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:30,552
The greatest fortress
ever built--

201
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:34,122
the tallest towers,
the strongest walls.

202
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:37,693
The Great Hall
had 35 hearths.

203
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,863
35. Can you imagine?

204
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,531
Look at it now--

205
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,534
<i>a blasted ruin.</i>

206
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,637
Do you know
what happened?

207
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,972
Dragons?

208
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:55,077
Yes, dragons happened.

209
00:13:57,514 --> 00:14:02,017
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

210
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:07,288
A million men could have marched
on these walls

211
00:14:07,323 --> 00:14:09,691
and a million men
would have been repelled.

212
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:15,329
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire-- mm.

213
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:18,765
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

214
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,736
Aegon Targaryen
changed the rules.

215
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,738
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

216
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,874
300 years after his death.

217
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,277
Aegon and his sisters.

218
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,879
Mm?

219
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,149
It wasn't just Aegon
riding his dragon.

220
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,018
It was Rhaenys
and Visenya, too.

221
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,321
Correct.

222
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,590
A student of history,
are you?

223
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:46,093
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

224
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,962
Visenya rode Vhagar.

225
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm sure I knew that
when I was a boy.

226
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:56,605
Visenya Targaryen
was a great warrior.

227
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,541
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

228
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,877
Hmm.

229
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:04,080
She's a heroine
of yours, I take it?

230
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:06,982
Aren't most girls
more interested

231
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:08,951
in the pretty maidens
from the songs?

232
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,085
<i>Jonquil with the flowers</i>
<i>in her hair?</i>

233
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,588
- Most girls are idiots.
- <i>Ha!</i>

234
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,457
You remind me
of my daughter.

235
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,060
Where did you learn
all this stuff

236
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:24,097
about Visenya and her
Valyrian Steel sword?

237
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:27,000
From my father.

238
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,606
He was a well-read
stonemason.

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,911
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

240
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,715
Have you met many
stonemasons, My Lord?

241
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,120
Careful now, girl.

242
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,356
<i>I enjoy you,</i>
<i>but be careful.</i>

243
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,225
Take that back
to the kitchen.

244
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,027
Eat what you want.

245
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,098
And, girl.

246
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,869
M'lord.

247
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,939
Lowborn girls
say "M'lord,"

248
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,342
<i>not "My Lord."</i>

249
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,611
If you're going
to pose as a commoner,

250
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,780
you should do it
properly.

251
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,916
My mother served
Lady Dustin

252
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,885
for many years,
My Lord.

253
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,389
She taught me how to speak
proper-- properly.

254
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:23,993
You're too smart
for your own good.

255
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:27,229
- <i>Has anyone told you that?</i>
- Yes.

256
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:29,932
Go on.

257
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:44,579
I beg pardon, Ser.

258
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:46,915
I should have
come to you after

259
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:49,251
to thank you
for saving me.

260
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,620
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

261
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:55,190
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

262
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,992
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

263
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,929
No. It gives me joy
to kill people.

264
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,230
Spare me.
You can't tell me

265
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:06,233
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

266
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,436
It was his duty.
He never liked it.

267
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,538
Is that what he told you?

268
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,006
He lied.

269
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,976
Killing is the sweetest
thing there is.

270
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,644
Why are you always
so hateful?

271
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,446
You'll be glad
of the hateful things I do

272
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:24,249
someday when you're queen
and I'm all that stands

273
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,752
between you
and your beloved king.

274
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:37,998
I've demanded a meeting
of the Thirteen.

275
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,833
One of them did this
or knows who did.

276
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:41,435
You are one
of the Thirteen.

277
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,504
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

278
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:46,807
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

279
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:49,443
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

280
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:52,212
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

281
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,214
would buy me
I cannot buy already?

282
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,382
We will get them back.

283
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,250
There is no we,

284
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,786
so why would you help me
get them back?

285
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,587
I took you
under my protection

286
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,689
in front of the rulers
of my city.

287
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,759
A man is what others
say he is and no more.

288
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,396
If they say that
Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

289
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:12,866
my word is worth nothing.

290
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,469
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

291
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:17,872
But it did happen
under your roof.

292
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:21,475
Khaleesi, many times
in my life I have been--

293
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,244
I don't care
where you've been.

294
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:50,101
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

295
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:54,072
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

296
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,641
We're free.

297
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,468
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down

298
00:18:58,493 --> 00:18:59,945
as man and woman,

299
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:02,514
we'd shove a spear
up his ass.

300
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,483
We don't go serving
some shit king

301
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,084
who's only king
because his father was.

302
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,522
No. No, you serve
Mance Rayder,

303
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:10,956
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

304
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,893
We chose Mance Rayder
to lead us.

305
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:16,296
He was a crow,
same as you,

306
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,598
but he wanted
to be free.

307
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,104
You could be free, too.

308
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,738
You don't need to live
your whole life

309
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:26,973
taking commands
from old men.

310
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,976
Wake up when you want
to wake up.

311
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,912
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

312
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:37,148
<i>Build yourself a cabin and find</i>
<i>a woman to lie with in the night.</i>

313
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:40,751
You're a pretty lad.

314
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:44,154
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

315
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,293
Walk.

316
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,596
I could teach you
how to do it.

317
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:54,832
I know how to do it.

318
00:19:57,302 --> 00:20:00,672
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

319
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,135
And what did she say?

320
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,804
She admired your spirit,
Your Grace.

321
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:35,839
And what then?

322
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:40,011
She, uh...

323
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:42,013
If every man
were held accountable

324
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:44,015
for the actions
of every distant relative,

325
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,218
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

326
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:53,591
She tore the paper
in half, Your Grace.

327
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,126
You've acted with honor.

328
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,228
I thank you for it.

329
00:20:57,262 --> 00:21:00,298
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

330
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:01,799
And give him a hot supper.

331
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:04,303
Ser Alton's pen
is occupied, Your Grace.

332
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,872
The prisoners
from the Yellow Fork.

333
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,941
Too many prisoners.

334
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,711
Is there room
for Ser Alton?

335
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,948
Does he need
to lie down?

336
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,220
Have the men
build him a new pen.

337
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,889
<i>Put him in with</i>
<i>the Kingslayer for now.</i>

338
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:24,092
Have your boy
watch over them.

339
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,761
Torrhen.

340
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,429
That will be all.

341
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,636
Your Grace.

342
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,905
<i>A minute of your time?</i>

343
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,356
I've been treating
your wounded men.

344
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,002
And my enemies
as some of my bannermen

345
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:59,694
are fond of mentioning.

346
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,329
They're not my enemies.

347
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,465
That's what I tell
my bannermen.

348
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:06,201
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

349
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:07,635
Some are easily replaced--

350
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,638
egg yolks, turpentine,
oil of roses.

351
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:13,074
But some are not.

352
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:16,176
I need silk
for stitching.

353
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:20,447
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

354
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,682
Mostly I need
milk of the poppy.

355
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,885
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

356
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,932
I assume there will be
more loss of limb before

357
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,522
this war is over.

358
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:33,560
- If you need help finding these--
- I know where to find them.

359
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:37,398
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
interrupt you.

360
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:40,735
Continue, My Lady.

361
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,802
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

362
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,717
Yes.

363
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:51,280
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

364
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:53,481
I expect he will.

365
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:55,450
If I could write a list--

366
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,885
come with me
to the Crag.

367
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,021
I don't think
that will be--

368
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,357
Let the Maester
show you his stores.

369
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:07,527
I want the wounded men
to be treated well--

370
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,463
all the wounded men.

371
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,540
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

372
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,743
Hurry up!

373
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,946
<i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

374
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,816
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

375
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,418
We've circled
this farmhouse twice.

376
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:31,053
There's no sign of them.

377
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:34,957
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

378
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,893
I'm looking at spending
the rest of life

379
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,863
being treated like a fool and
a eunuch by my own people.

380
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:41,898
Ask yourself, "Is there anything
I wouldn't do

381
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:43,500
to stop that
from happening?"

382
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,702
The hounds will find
the scent again.

383
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,004
I'll beat them
until they do.

384
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,405
I'll whip every man here

385
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,907
<i>until I have</i>
<i>both those boys in hand.</i>

386
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:54,909
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

387
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:58,779
It's better to be
cruel than weak.

388
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,047
Prince Theon.

389
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:03,216
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

390
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,450
The Stark boys.
Where are they?

391
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,719
I don't know.
I seen no one.

392
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:08,655
Oh!

393
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,123
Think harder.

394
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:14,328
I swear, m'lord,
I don't know.

395
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:17,265
My Lord, over here.

396
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,738
I think I've found
what we're looking for.

397
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:34,783
Send the old man home.

398
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,655
Go back to Winterfell.

399
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,524
Take him back.

400
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,262
Theon, don't do this.

401
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,482
You came back.

402
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:10,617
As soon as I heard.

403
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:13,220
Do you know anything?

404
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:16,290
- Irri is dead.
- <i>I know.</i>

405
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,527
- She was a good--
- she's dead.

406
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,329
She died alone.

407
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,831
She died for me
and I couldn't protect her.

408
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,601
Doreah?

409
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:28,670
We can't find her.

410
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:32,807
She must be dead, too.

411
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:34,976
I led my people
out of the Red Waste

412
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,578
and into
the slaughterhouse.

413
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,681
I should have been here.

414
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:42,051
You went to find me
a ship.

415
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:44,253
My place is by your side.

416
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:46,655
I shouldn't have left you
alone with these people.

417
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,323
These people?

418
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:50,825
They are not
to be trusted.

419
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,494
And who is to be trusted?

420
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:55,095
Who are my people?

421
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,331
The Targaryens?

422
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:59,233
I only knew one--
my brother,

423
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,468
and he would have let
1,000 men rape me

424
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:03,570
if it had got him
the crown.

425
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,205
The Dothraki?

426
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,428
Most of them turned on me
the day that Khal Drogo

427
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:08,909
fell from his horse.

428
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,677
Your people
are in Westeros.

429
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,413
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

430
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,482
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

431
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,718
They'll pray for my return?

432
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,221
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

433
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:23,392
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

434
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:25,861
You are not your brother.

435
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:28,463
Trust me, Khaleesi.

436
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:30,632
There it is--

437
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,901
"trust me."

438
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:35,537
And it's you I should trust,
Ser Jorah?

439
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:37,505
Only you?

440
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:43,644
I don't need trust
any longer.

441
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:46,513
I don't want it and I don't have
room for it.

442
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:48,682
You are too young
to be so--

443
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:50,918
And you are too familiar.

444
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:57,825
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

445
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:02,531
No one can survive
in this world without help.

446
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:03,999
No one.

447
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,636
Let me help you, please.

448
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,438
Tell me how.

449
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,741
Find my dragons.

450
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:23,319
How long till we get
back to your crows?

451
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,455
We're close.

452
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,993
What, a day?
A half-day?

453
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,599
You don't know, do you?

454
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:39,536
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

455
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:43,540
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

456
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:45,643
Nothing happened
between you and me.

457
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:49,047
"I swear it,
old master king crow, Ser,

458
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,816
we were only close
together for warmth.

459
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,452
And then I felt it,

460
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:56,188
right up against
me backside like a club.

461
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:58,690
I can show you the bruise
on me tailbone.

462
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:02,160
And before I knew
what was where, his-- his--

463
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:05,130
well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

464
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:09,201
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

465
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:12,203
And he spread me legs
and-- ruined.

466
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,905
The shame of it.

467
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,074
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

468
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,804
What will me poor
savage father say?"

469
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,778
Turn back around.

470
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,914
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

471
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:24,684
Turn back around.

472
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:27,386
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

473
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,522
since it's going to be
your word against mine,

474
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:33,425
and since you can't talk
about it without blushing,

475
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,529
we may as well just.

476
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:39,598
What, right here
in the muck?

477
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,834
I'll keep you
warm enough.

478
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:45,905
Are you that afraid
of it?

479
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,440
That's enough.

480
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,909
Oh, it's nice

481
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,978
and wet and warm.

482
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:54,814
Enough

483
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,717
it don't have teeth.

484
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,026
All right!

485
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,528
All right.

486
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:12,597
Gods, you're dull.

487
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:51,270
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

488
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,885
<i>No, no!</i>

489
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:26,438
No. Oh, no.

490
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,591
It's all right.
Give me that.

491
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:48,862
If the queen sees I can have
Joffrey's children now...

492
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,631
Help me flip it over.

493
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:10,182
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

494
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,186
You'll say nothing
to anyone.

495
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,321
Do you understand?

496
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,812
Your mother might have
prepared you.

497
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:42,215
You flowered, my dear.
No more.

498
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:45,418
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

499
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:46,953
In what way?

500
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,157
I thought
it would be less--

501
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:53,294
less messy.

502
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,097
Wait until you bear
the child.

503
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,234
You're a woman now.

504
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:02,337
Do you have any idea
what that means?

505
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,873
I'm fit to bear children
for the king?

506
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:07,343
A prospect that
once delighted you--

507
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,812
bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

508
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,548
the greatest honor
for a queen.

509
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:20,921
Joffrey has always
been difficult.

510
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,056
Even his birth,
I labored a day and a half

511
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,158
to bring him
into this world.

512
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:27,627
You cannot imagine
the pain.

513
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:29,563
I screamed so loudly,
I was sure

514
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,065
Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

515
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,134
His Grace was not
with you?

516
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,669
Robert was hunting.

517
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,572
That was his custom.

518
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,911
Whenever my time was near,

519
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:45,548
my royal husband
would flee to the trees

520
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:50,419
with his huntsmen
and his hounds.

521
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:51,987
And when he returned,
he would present me

522
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:55,223
with some pelts
or a stag's head,

523
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,124
and I would present him
with a baby.

524
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,562
Not that I wanted
him there, mind you.

525
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:04,631
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

526
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:06,633
and I had my brother.

527
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:10,004
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

528
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:13,374
he smiled and asked
which one of them

529
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,542
proposed to keep him out.

530
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,216
Joffrey will show you
no such devotion.

531
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,155
You may never
love the king,

532
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:28,056
but you will love
his children.

533
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,460
I love his Grace
with all my heart.

534
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:34,362
That's so very
touching to hear.

535
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,135
Permit me to share
some womanly wisdom with you

536
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:44,171
on this very special day.

537
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:48,007
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

538
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:51,611
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

539
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:55,348
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

540
00:33:57,718 --> 00:34:00,586
Love no one
but your children.

541
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,189
On that front,
a mother has no choice.

542
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:08,861
But... shouldn't
I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

543
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:14,033
You can try,

544
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:16,036
little dove.

545
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,555
Who did you say
your mother was again?

546
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,356
Cinda Lannister.

547
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,158
Is she the fat one?

548
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,927
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she--

549
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:44,730
No, no. There's only one
fat Lannister.

550
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:47,634
If she was your mother,
you'd know it.

551
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,439
I-- I squired
for you once, you know?

552
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,075
When?

553
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,512
The tournament the day
of Willem Frey's wedding.

554
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:01,583
I went to
Willem Frey's wedding?

555
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,418
<i>You did.</i>

556
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:05,887
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he--

557
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:08,056
He threw up on his horse

558
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,624
on the way
to the tourney grounds.

559
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,193
- What was his name?
- Bryan.

560
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:15,395
Poor lad.

561
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,432
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

562
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,802
I remember you.

563
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:25,704
You had never squired
for anyone before.

564
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:27,673
That's right.
I ran up and volunteered.

565
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:31,076
"Let me, My Lord.
Let me."

566
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,545
My father was furious,

567
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,314
afraid I'd embarrass
our family

568
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:37,782
in front of the family.

569
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:41,352
You didn't, though.

570
00:35:41,387 --> 00:35:43,854
- You really remember?
- Mm.

571
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,390
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

572
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,958
It's a rare talent.

573
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:51,761
Most of my squires,
they mean well,

574
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:55,232
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

575
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,133
Well, when I think
back to that day--

576
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:08,944
You were saying?

577
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:11,381
I--

578
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:14,317
never mind.
It's embarrassing.

579
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:17,054
More embarrassing
than being chained to a post

580
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,856
covered in your own shit?

581
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,861
I remember everything
about that day--

582
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:25,230
your helmet, your horse,

583
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,966
the rake line in the dirt
along the list,

584
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:29,468
where the sun was
in the sky

585
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:31,703
when you knocked
Balon Swann from his horse,

586
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:34,940
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

587
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:39,911
I'll remember it all
until I die.

588
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,448
That was the best day
of my life.

589
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:50,388
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

590
00:36:50,422 --> 00:36:51,890
All the competitors
were done.

591
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:53,926
I was the last one
out there.

592
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,697
And I couldn't leave.

593
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:01,000
<i>I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to go and sit with my family</i>

594
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:03,202
at a table so far
on the edge of the feast

595
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:05,571
you could barely
even see the bride.

596
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,039
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

597
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,556
when I knew that they could
never have the faintest idea

598
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:11,872
what I was talking about.

599
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,848
I understand completely.

600
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:18,918
How could you?

601
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:21,855
S-sorry, I-- I didn't
mean to doubt you.

602
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:25,391
- It's just that I--
- I was 16 once.

603
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:28,895
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

604
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:30,597
Which knight was it?

605
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,399
Barristan Selmy.

606
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:36,669
The fight against
the Kingswood outlaws.

607
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:39,372
Before your time.

608
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:40,907
What was he like?

609
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,147
He was

610
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,016
a painter,

611
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,353
a painter
who only used red.

612
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:59,927
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

613
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:02,163
not back then.

614
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,553
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something

615
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:06,578
that perfect...

616
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:11,373
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

617
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,076
It's hard to put
into words.

618
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,246
It's like stepping
into a dream

619
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,449
you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember

620
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:22,318
and finding out
that the dream

621
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,388
is more real
than your life.

622
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,928
Leaving
that battlefield was

623
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:33,063
like being dragged off
to prison.

624
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:36,467
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

625
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,238
I didn't have your gift.

626
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:43,609
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

627
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:46,945
I was awful,
a complete liability...

628
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:50,582
until one of the outlaws

629
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:54,185
decided to take on
a 16-year-old squire.

630
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:02,425
It's a good thing
I am who I am.

631
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,129
I'd have been useless
at anything else.

632
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:13,770
I'm not well-suited
for imprisonment.

633
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,506
Shocking, I know.

634
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,241
Some men are.

635
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:20,778
Ned Stark--
I imagine he made

636
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:24,249
an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

637
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:27,752
But me, though--
my life has left me

638
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:30,822
uniquely unfit
for constraint.

639
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:33,991
Have you thought about...?

640
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,626
Of course.

641
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,529
- Every day.
- And?

642
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:44,701
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

643
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:46,870
The Starks
are very careful.

644
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:52,209
But there is a way,
I think.

645
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:54,879
It wasn't possible
until now.

646
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:58,116
What is it?

647
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:05,224
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

648
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:08,060
You'll only have
to do one thing.

649
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,962
Tell me.

650
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:14,667
You'll have to die.

651
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:10,488
Jorah the Andal.

652
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:13,624
This man must sail
past old Valyria.

653
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:17,962
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

654
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:19,897
I didn't come here
for lessons.

655
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,200
No, you came
for the dragons.

656
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:24,302
You have them?

657
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,472
Where are they?

658
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:29,507
Draw your sword.

659
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:33,210
See what your steel
is worth.

660
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:39,817
You want to please
the Mother of Dragons.

661
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:47,224
You love her.

662
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:52,329
Where are the dragons?

663
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:56,233
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

664
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:03,640
Will you betray her again?

665
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,511
Never.

666
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:15,517
<i>The thief you seek</i>

667
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:18,519
is with her now.

668
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,292
<i>I did not leave</i>
<i>the comfort of my home</i>

669
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,093
to come to yours
and be called a thief.

670
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,062
No one is calling you
a thief.

671
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:30,797
Who is she to accuse us?

672
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,833
Please,
they're my children.

673
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,135
- I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

674
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,604
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

675
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,340
Without me,
the dragons will die.

676
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,442
It will be
for the best.

677
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,745
<i>Your dragons</i>
<i>will bring the world</i>

678
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,548
nothing but death
and misery, my dear.

679
00:42:47,582 --> 00:42:49,984
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

680
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:51,953
<i>You are cruel, my friend.</i>

681
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,956
The mother of dragons
is in the right.

682
00:42:54,991 --> 00:42:58,127
<i>She must be reunited</i>
<i>with her babies.</i>

683
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:02,031
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

684
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:05,735
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

685
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,737
where I have put them.

686
00:43:08,772 --> 00:43:10,907
You have my dragons?

687
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:13,210
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

688
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:15,946
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

689
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,382
He procured them for me.

690
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:22,386
- But there is no King of Qarth.
- There is now.

691
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,621
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

692
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:29,927
<i>You would keep your gates</i>
<i>and your minds closed</i>

693
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:33,098
to everything
outside your walls,

694
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:36,234
but Qarth cannot remain
the greatest city that ever was

695
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:37,903
if it refuses to change.

696
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:40,573
I will open Qarth
to the world

697
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:44,878
as I have forced it
to open itself to me.

698
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:47,847
Your ambition
is an inspiration.

699
00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:50,917
But like all upstarts,
you overreach.

700
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:53,686
Three dragons
the size of cats

701
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:56,022
and an alliance
with a charlatan

702
00:43:56,056 --> 00:43:58,558
do not make you a king.

703
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,793
An upstart
and a charlatan?

704
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:03,863
<i>Empires have been</i>
<i>built by less.</i>

705
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:07,333
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

706
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:09,701
and those in the center
make room for them,

707
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,436
<i>willingly or otherwise.</i>

708
00:44:15,774 --> 00:44:19,143
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

709
00:44:20,712 --> 00:44:22,246
She will give them
her love

710
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:25,049
and they will thrive
by her side...

711
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,286
forever.

712
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:51,644
A mother should be
with her children.

713
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,451
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

714
00:44:57,485 --> 00:45:00,788
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

715
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:03,125
Come see them.

716
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,270
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

717
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:16,038
Keep your hands
off me, woman.

718
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:19,742
Don't enter without
an invitation, <i>man.</i>

719
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:23,212
Forgive me.
Lady Stark.

720
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:25,915
- <i>What is it?</i>
- They caught the Kingslayer.

721
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:34,523
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

722
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:40,029
You'll die today.

723
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:42,531
Justice for
the Karstark.

724
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:57,314
Gut him!

725
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,229
Get back!
I want his head!

726
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,899
Any man who stands
between a father

727
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:18,435
and his vengeance
asks for death.

728
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,704
Lord Karstark,

729
00:46:20,738 --> 00:46:23,640
this man
is our prisoner.

730
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:25,575
This monster
killed my son.

731
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,645
And crippled mine.

732
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:29,446
He will answer
for his crimes,

733
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:31,514
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>but not here.</i>

734
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,851
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me--

735
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:36,286
You will strike me down?

736
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,622
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

737
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:40,724
<i>I am the widow of your</i>
<i>liege Lord Eddark Stark.</i>

738
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,259
I am the mother
of your king!

739
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:45,128
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

740
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:47,298
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

741
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:51,068
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

742
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:53,003
He brought that
foreign bitch with him.

743
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:53,845
How dare you?

744
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,991
Threatening My Lady
is an act of treason.

745
00:46:56,075 --> 00:46:57,275
Treason?

746
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,077
How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

747
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,179
I understand
your grief, My Lord--

748
00:47:01,214 --> 00:47:03,648
better than most
I understand it--

749
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,618
but in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

750
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:08,687
stand down.

751
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:11,990
When your son returns,

752
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:14,426
<i>I will demand</i>
<i>this murderer's head.</i>

753
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,695
Wise men do not
make demands of kings.

754
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:19,931
Fathers who love
their sons do.

755
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:22,300
I will have his head.

756
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:27,705
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

757
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,573
I would have come
to your defense, but--

758
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:32,275
Take him to the stockades.

759
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,511
Bind him with every chain
you can find!

760
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,045
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

761
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,248
There's not much fish
left in you.

762
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:39,983
And gag him!

763
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:47,356
Since when do you light
your own candles?

764
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,725
Since I decided that
I can't stand to look

765
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,295
at any of my handmaidens
for another instant.

766
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:57,767
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

767
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:01,471
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

768
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:04,141
past Tarth-- 200 ships.

769
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:08,312
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

770
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:10,714
He'll be at our gates
within five days,

771
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:12,449
four if he has the wind.

772
00:48:12,484 --> 00:48:15,219
We have strong,
high walls.

773
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,322
We'll rain fire
down on them from above.

774
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,491
"Rain fire on them
from above."

775
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,359
You're quoting father,
aren't you?

776
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:23,827
Why not?

777
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,762
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

778
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:28,565
We call it tactics,
not strategy.

779
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,734
But, yes, he does have
a good mind for it.

780
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:32,603
The best mind,
some would say.

781
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:34,605
Sadly, he's not here.

782
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,908
It's just you,
me, and Joffrey,

783
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:40,110
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms

784
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,912
and protector of the realm.

785
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:45,382
I'm sure you'll make
a point eventually.

786
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:48,785
He needs to start
acting like a king.

787
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,988
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

788
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:54,324
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead--

789
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:56,626
I'm not the one giving
the boy whores to abuse.

790
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,761
I thought the girls
might help him.

791
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:01,196
- Did you?
- <i>I was wrong.</i>

792
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:06,500
If we can't
control him...

793
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:08,135
Do you think
I haven't tried?

794
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,374
He doesn't listen to me.

795
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,112
It's hard to put
a leash on a dog

796
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:20,881
once you've put
a crown on its head.

797
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,920
I always hoped
he'd be like Jaime.

798
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,225
He looks like him...

799
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,965
in a certain light.

800
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:41,304
The boy is more
Robert than Jaime.

801
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:45,308
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

802
00:49:47,244 --> 00:49:50,413
Sometimes I wonder...

803
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,848
What?

804
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:56,285
If this is the price

805
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,655
for what we've done,
for our sins.

806
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:02,724
Sins?

807
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:04,292
The Targaryens--

808
00:50:04,326 --> 00:50:05,905
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years,

809
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,930
I know.

810
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:13,201
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

811
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:17,206
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

812
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:22,379
Half the Targaryens
went mad, didn't they?

813
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:23,814
What's the saying?

814
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:28,385
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

815
00:50:28,419 --> 00:50:30,921
You've beaten the odds.

816
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:33,556
Tommen and Myrcella
are good, decent children,

817
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,425
both of them.

818
00:51:02,884 --> 00:51:05,685
- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

819
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,488
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

820
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,690
So is saving
Lannisters, yeah?

821
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:13,492
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

822
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:16,028
Your son returns
at dawn, My Lady?

823
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:17,630
So they say.

824
00:51:17,664 --> 00:51:20,500
<i>The Kingslayer</i>
<i>won't last the night.</i>

825
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:22,868
<i>The more they drink,</i>
<i>the angrier they'll get.</i>

826
00:51:24,104 --> 00:51:26,271
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

827
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,741
<i>who wants to die</i>
<i>defending a Lannister?</i>

828
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,345
Come.

829
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,631
I need to be alone
with him.

830
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:54,535
- My Lady, our orders--
- your orders, which I just gave you,

831
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,137
are to leave me
alone with him.

832
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:04,277
Come to say goodbye,
Lady Stark?

833
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:09,116
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

834
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:10,584
Is that a woman?

835
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,387
Do you hear them
out there?

836
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,057
They want your head.

837
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,560
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

838
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,830
You strangled his son
with your chains.

839
00:52:22,865 --> 00:52:25,133
Oh, oh.

840
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,801
Was he the one
on guard duty?

841
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:31,206
He was in my way.

842
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,840
Any Knight would have
done the same.

843
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,043
You are no Knight.

844
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:37,646
You have forsaken
every vow you ever took.

845
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,447
So many vows.

846
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:41,249
They make you swear
and swear.

847
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,084
<i>Defend the king,</i>
<i>obey the king,</i>

848
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,653
<i>obey your father,</i>

849
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:48,956
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

850
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,826
But what if your father
despises the king?

851
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,463
What if the king
massacres the innocent?

852
00:52:56,497 --> 00:52:58,699
It's too much.

853
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:02,269
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

854
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:05,138
Where did you find
this beast?

855
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,376
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

856
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:11,712
Kingslayer.

857
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:14,348
Kingslayer.

858
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:16,683
What a king he was.

859
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:20,388
<i>Here's to Aerys Targaryen,</i>
<i>the second of his name,</i>

860
00:53:20,422 --> 00:53:23,591
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the realm,

861
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:27,596
and to the sword
I shoved in his back.

862
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:31,833
You are a man
without honor.

863
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:35,337
Do you know

864
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:38,607
I've never been with
any woman but Cersei?

865
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:41,476
So in my own way,

866
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:46,649
I have more honor
than poor old dead Ned.

867
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:50,520
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

868
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:54,158
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

869
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:58,362
Snow, a bastard
from the North.

870
00:53:58,397 --> 00:54:01,166
Now, when--
when good old Ned

871
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,603
came home with
some whore's baby,

872
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:07,806
did you pretend
to love it?

873
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,010
<i>No. You're not very good</i>
<i>at pretending.</i>

874
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,212
<i>You're an honest woman.</i>

875
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:17,615
You hated that boy,
didn't you?

876
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:20,084
<i>How could you not</i>
<i>hate him?</i>

877
00:54:20,118 --> 00:54:22,719
<i>The walking,</i>
<i>talking reminder</i>

878
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:26,422
that the honorable
Lord Eddark Stark

879
00:54:26,457 --> 00:54:29,192
fucked another woman.

880
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,830
Your sword.

881
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:41,540
I told you
what would happen.

882
00:54:41,574 --> 00:54:43,842
All of you--

883
00:54:45,479 --> 00:54:49,815
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

884
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,018
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

885
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:54,887
What are you doing?
What have you done?

886
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:57,122
If there's any who still question
whether your new lord

887
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:58,791
means what he says...

888
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:04,430
Here is the answer
to your question.

889
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:15,976
No!
