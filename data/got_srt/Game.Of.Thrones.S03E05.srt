1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,770
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,238
You must see Highgarden.

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,674
I don't think the queen would
let me leave King's Landing.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,609
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:14,282
And if you were
to marry Loras...

6
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,919
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

7
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,457
- I have a wife.
- She's shut away in a tower.

8
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:22,660
And she's given you no sons,
only stillborns.

9
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:26,532
I lost one son to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

10
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,134
I grieve for
your sons, my lord.

11
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:30,436
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

12
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:37,209
Do that again and I'll
take your other hand.

13
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:39,480
- What value was the mill?
- I seized an opportunity.

14
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,683
<i>We took hostages-- Willem
Lannister, Martyn Lannister.<i>

15
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,313
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

16
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:47,344
I'm not your enemy.

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,745
- This woman is evil!
- Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.

18
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:52,113
You want to assassinate a girl?

19
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:55,082
- Based on whose information?
- <i>Ser Jorah Mormont.<i>

20
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:57,384
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

21
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,720
You bring us the whispers
of a traitor.

22
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:02,023
Beric Dondarrion?
If you mean to murder me,

23
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,826
then bloody well
get on with it.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,228
You'll die soon enough,
but it won't be murder.

25
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,831
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,968
Is it done, then?

27
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,550
Dracarys.

28
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:33,474
Lord, cast your light upon us.

29
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:36,145
Lord of Light, defend us.

30
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,916
Show us the truth.

31
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,317
Strike this man down
if he is guilty.

32
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,819
Give strength to his sword
if he is true.

33
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:49,956
<i>Lord of Light, give us wisdom.<i>

34
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,329
For the night is dark

35
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:58,831
and full of terrors.

36
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,934
For the night is
dark and full of terrors.

37
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,462
Get back.

38
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:55,259
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

39
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:58,028
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

40
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,765
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.

41
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,701
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

42
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,169
Kill him!

43
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,851
Lord, cast your light
upon this man, your servant.

44
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,727
Bring him back
from death and darkness.

45
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,029
His flame has been
extinguished.

46
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,797
Restore it.

47
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,366
<i>For the night is
dark and full of terrors.<i>

48
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,635
- <i>Lord, cast...</i>
- Arya, don't!

49
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,104
Bring him back
from death and darkness...

50
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,873
No!

51
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:41,976
Let go of me!
Let me go!

52
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,112
Looks like their god likes me
more than your butcher's boy.

53
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,747
Burn in hell!

54
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,749
<i>He will.<i>

55
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,322
But not today.

56
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:22,019
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

57
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,621
Tell me what you know.

58
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,389
There are 4
to a patrol--

59
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:28,291
2 builders to check
for structural damage,

60
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,759
2 rangers to watch
for enemies.

61
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:31,861
How often do these
patrols go out?

62
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:34,797
It varies.

63
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,467
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

64
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,970
You'd like to know that.

65
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,475
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

66
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:48,312
How many are manned?

67
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,682
3.

68
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:53,385
You sure of that?

69
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,655
Which 3?

70
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,826
Castle Black.

71
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,694
Aye, Castle Black.

72
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,829
Everyone knows Castle Black.

73
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,864
Which others?

74
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,472
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

75
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:17,408
and the Shadow Tower.

76
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,645
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

77
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,414
- 1,000.
- Liar.

78
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,585
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

79
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,154
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

80
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,489
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

81
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,024
He's no crow.

82
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,427
Just 'cause you want him inside
you don't make him one of us.

83
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,963
I'm not afraid of you.

84
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,137
I like you, boy.

85
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:50,074
But if you lie to me,

86
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:53,344
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

87
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,881
1,000 men.

88
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,756
We'll find out soon enough.

89
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,331
I don't need you to protect me.

90
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,766
Of course you do.

91
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,635
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he
was about to cut your throat?

92
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,471
Who vouched for you with Mance?

93
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,540
It seems you owe me a debt.

94
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,411
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

95
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:31,147
It's mine. If you want
it, come steal it back.

96
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:34,951
<i>Ygritte!<i>

97
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,054
<i>Ygritte!<i>

98
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,327
Ygritte!
Seven hells.

99
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:46,496
<i>Ygritte!<i>

100
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,403
Is Orell right?

101
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:54,405
Are you still a crow?

102
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:59,176
It's time you proved yourself.

103
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,945
Ygritte.

104
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,581
You swore some vows.

105
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,516
I want you to break 'em.

106
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,787
I want you to see me.

107
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:15,625
All of me.

108
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,074
We shouldn't.

109
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,345
We should.

110
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:57,300
Why are you still dressed?

111
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:59,836
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

112
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:16,886
That thing you did

113
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,888
with your mouth--

114
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:23,260
is that what lords do to
their ladies in the South?

115
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,429
I don't know.

116
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,231
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

117
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:28,733
Hmm.

118
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,468
You seemed to like it.

119
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,904
Aye, I liked it some.

120
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,506
Who taught you that?

121
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,409
There's been no one else.
Only you.

122
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,344
A maid.

123
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,213
You were a maid.

124
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,149
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

125
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,086
How about you?
Were you a maid?

126
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,521
What do you think?

127
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,423
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

128
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,059
He came trading
with his brothers.

129
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:58,262
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

130
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,197
But...

131
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,733
he was weak.

132
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,468
Not like you.

133
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:06,437
That was the first one.

134
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:08,440
Then there was this Thenn boy.

135
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,910
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

136
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:15,113
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

137
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,751
We'd best get back.

138
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,154
Tormund--

139
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,492
I'm not done with you yet.

140
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,934
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

141
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,585
Let's not go back.

142
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,489
Let's stay here a while longer.

143
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:03,161
I don't ever want to leave
this cave, Jon Snow.

144
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,331
Not ever.

145
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,378
<i>I want my gold.

146
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,846
It says it clearly
right there on that note

147
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,448
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

148
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:24,817
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

149
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,052
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

150
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,587
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

151
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,588
Come try it, archer.

152
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,223
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

153
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,793
You can't let him go. He's a murderer.
He's guilty.

154
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,961
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

155
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:39,165
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

156
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:45,004
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.

157
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,772
The Lord of Light
isn't done with you yet.

158
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,746
<i>Riders coming through!<i>

159
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,859
The Kingslayer.

160
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:07,961
Down!

161
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,163
On your knees.

162
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:13,300
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

163
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,904
Pick him up, Locke.

164
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,979
You've lost a hand.

165
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,848
No, my lord, he has it here.

166
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,286
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

167
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,422
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

168
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:39,126
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

169
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,194
You're under my protection now.

170
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,864
Thank you, my lord.

171
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:49,169
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

172
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:51,939
We'll speak later.

173
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,076
Lord Bolton.

174
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,948
Is there word from the capital?

175
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,751
You haven't heard?

176
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,922
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

177
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,391
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.<i>

178
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.<i>

179
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,698
And your sister...

180
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,172
How can I put this?

181
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,109
Your sister...

182
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,646
is alive and well.

183
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,482
Your father's forces prevailed.

184
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,085
Ser Jaime isn't well.

185
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,554
Take him to Qyburn.

186
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,375
- Will I die?
- No.

187
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,810
The corruption has spread.

188
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,845
I fear it must be cut away.

189
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,948
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

190
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,417
Then you'll die.

191
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,422
You're no maester.

192
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,191
Where's your chain?

193
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,293
The Citadel stripped me of it.

194
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:23,563
They found some
of my experiments

195
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,565
too bold.

196
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,237
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

197
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:33,041
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

198
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,511
I can take away
the rotting flesh

199
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:39,214
and try and burn out
the corruption

200
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,483
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

201
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,718
With any luck,
that will suffice.

202
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,254
You'll need milk of the poppy.

203
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,557
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

204
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,761
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

205
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,897
I'll scream loudly.

206
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,267
Lord Baelish.

207
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,935
Your Grace.

208
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,937
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

209
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,372
Of course, Your Grace.

210
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:37,806
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

211
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,875
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

212
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,379
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

213
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,348
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

214
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:50,051
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

215
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:53,188
And he appreciates those who aid
his family, as you well know.

216
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,757
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

217
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,993
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

218
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,494
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

219
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,430
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

220
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,632
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

221
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,136
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

222
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,938
I assure you that it will.

223
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,546
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

224
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:21,981
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

225
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,217
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

226
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:26,353
I always take figs
mid afternoon.

227
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:27,854
They help move the bowels.

228
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,956
To what do I owe this summons?

229
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:32,025
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

230
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,294
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

231
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:38,098
I climbed all those steps to
discuss financial matters?

232
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,399
It's the royal wedding.

233
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,834
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

234
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,035
Naturally.

235
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:44,537
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

236
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,672
The word extravagant
has been used.

237
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,374
What good
is the word extravagant

238
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:50,810
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

239
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,912
- I understand that.
- Good.

240
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:55,414
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

241
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,082
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

242
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,619
As of now, it's a huge expense.

243
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:00,786
And?

244
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:04,490
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

245
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,893
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

246
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,294
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

247
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:10,062
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.

248
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:12,698
What is it, 12,000 infantrymen

249
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,533
<i>the Tyrell family has supplied?

250
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,835
1,800 mounted lances.

251
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,837
<i>2,000 in support.

252
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:21,974
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

253
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:23,709
<i>A million bushels of wheat.

254
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:27,279
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

255
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,081
<i>20,000 head of cattle.<i>

256
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:30,683
<i>50,000 sheep.<i>

257
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:33,186
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

258
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,222
I'm quite familiar with them.

259
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,924
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

260
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,493
which are necessary for the
preservation of the realm.

261
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,396
As is a royal wedding.

262
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,999
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

263
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,467
They crave distractions.

264
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:48,770
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

265
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,440
And their distractions
are likely to end

266
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,742
with us being torn to pieces.

267
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,111
<i>A royal wedding is much safer.<i>

268
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:59,181
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

269
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,383
<i>And traditionally paid for<i>

270
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,486
by the royal family.

271
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,156
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

272
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,191
and thoroughly debauched.

273
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:10,793
You can imagine
my disappointment

274
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,796
at finding nothing but a
browbeaten bookkeeper.

275
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,267
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

276
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,203
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

277
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,239
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

278
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,974
refuses to play its part.

279
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:26,542
We'll pay for half the expenses

280
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,211
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

281
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,046
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

282
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,416
Very good, then. That's settled.
Good day.

283
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,554
Give me that.

284
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,194
<i>What are you doing?<i>

285
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,331
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

286
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,567
Why?

287
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:53,002
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

288
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:54,904
Have you lost your mind?

289
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:58,441
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

290
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:00,076
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

291
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,878
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
before I joined the Brotherhood.

292
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,847
You don't have to do this.

293
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,682
I want to.

294
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:08,150
They need good men.

295
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,487
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

296
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,889
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

297
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,960
I've served men my entire life.

298
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,795
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

299
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:22,431
and he sold me to the Watch.

300
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,066
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

301
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,035
wondering every day if I'd
get tortured or killed.

302
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,471
I'm done serving.

303
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,840
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

304
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:36,644
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

305
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,814
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

306
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:43,418
I've never had a family.

307
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,090
I can be your family.

308
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,963
You wouldn't be my family.

309
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,598
You'd be "my lady."

310
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,286
Willem.

311
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:20,457
Willem!

312
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:26,831
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth! Take him!

313
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,233
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

314
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:31,068
Please--

315
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,283
Bring them in.

316
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,266
Is that all of them?

317
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:08,606
It took 5 of you to
murder 2 unarmed squires?

318
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,541
Not murder, Your Grace.

319
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,109
Vengeance.

320
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:14,645
Vengeance?

321
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,047
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

322
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,150
I saw Harrion die on the
battlefield and Torrhen--

323
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:22,185
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

324
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,487
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

325
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,424
Look at them.

326
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:31,860
Tell your mother
to look at them.

327
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,196
<i>She killed them as much as I.<i>

328
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,865
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

329
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,733
This was your treason.

330
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,202
It's treason
to free your enemies.

331
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,337
In war, you kill your enemies.

332
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,473
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

333
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,541
Leave him.

334
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,314
Aye.

335
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,682
Leave me to the king.

336
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:59,353
He wants to give me a scolding
before he sets me free.

337
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:03,857
That's how he deals
with treason.

338
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,193
Our King in the North.

339
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,595
Or should I call him

340
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,665
the King Who Lost the North?

341
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,003
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

342
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,738
Hang the rest.

343
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,240
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

344
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,742
I only watched for the guards.

345
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,911
This one was only the watcher.

346
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,013
Hang him last so he can
watch the others die.

347
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,149
<i>Please! Please, no.<i>
They made me do it!

348
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:32,119
They made me!
They made me!

349
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,630
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

350
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,532
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

351
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,267
The Lannisters pay their debts.

352
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,702
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.<i>

353
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,671
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

354
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,439
It wouldn't be lying.

355
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,674
We will bury them
and remain silent

356
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,109
<i>until the war is done.<i>

357
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:56,544
I'm not fighting for justice

358
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,447
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

359
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,417
<i>no matter how highborn.<i>

360
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,020
He has to die.

361
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:07,756
The Karstarks are Northmen.

362
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,125
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

363
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,127
Your mother's right.

364
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,930
If you do this, the
Karstarks will abandon you.

365
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:17,032
You tended to their wounds.

366
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,769
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

367
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:23,640
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

368
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:25,809
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.<i>

369
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,278
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

370
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:30,380
A hostage.

371
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,718
<i>Tell the Karstarks that as
long as they remain loyal,<i>

372
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:35,820
he will not be harmed.

373
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:04,115
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

374
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,151
as much as yours, boy.

375
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,887
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

376
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:13,525
I fought Joffrey for you.

377
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,027
We are kin--

378
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:17,362
Stark and Karstark.

379
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,797
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

380
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:21,399
And it won't save you now.

381
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,301
I don't want it to save me.

382
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:27,972
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

383
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:30,641
Kneel, my lord.

384
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:42,119
Rickard Karstark,

385
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,721
<i>Lord of Karhold,<i>

386
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:47,259
here in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.

387
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:50,195
Would you speak a final word?

388
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:53,866
Kill me and be cursed.

389
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:57,003
You are no king of mine.

390
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:13,619
<i>Joffrey.<i>

391
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,654
Cersei.

392
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,325
Ilyn Payne.

393
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:22,896
Ser Meryn.

394
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:28,102
The Hound.

395
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,541
What are you
going to do with me?

396
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:36,211
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

397
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,079
Your brother's there now.

398
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,582
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

399
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,284
and you can go home.

400
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:45,053
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

401
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:46,522
Don't think of it that way.

402
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:49,224
- But it is that way.
- <i>It is.<i>

403
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,093
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

404
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:57,232
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

405
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,401
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

406
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:02,937
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

407
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:16,718
Do I frighten you, child?

408
00:28:16,753 --> 00:28:18,587
No.

409
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:23,158
You're angry with me.

410
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,826
And I don't blame you.

411
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,380
But letting him go
was the right thing.

412
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:28,964
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

413
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,499
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

414
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,368
But how...?

415
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,570
Thoros...

416
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,472
how many times
have you brought me back?

417
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:40,975
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

418
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,243
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

419
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:45,912
- How many times?
- <i>5, I think.<i>

420
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:48,081
<i>No, this makes 6.<i>

421
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,449
6.

422
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:52,452
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

423
00:28:52,486 --> 00:28:54,020
<i>Show her.<i>

424
00:28:54,054 --> 00:28:57,823
Lance right through the chest.

425
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,293
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

426
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:01,694
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

427
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,463
<i>And that axe in the side.<i>

428
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,833
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

429
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:11,704
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

430
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:14,907
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

431
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,476
<i>And the Hound makes 6.<i>

432
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,646
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

433
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,681
<i>You'd think you'd learn.<i>

434
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,919
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

435
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:27,954
<i>I know.<i>

436
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:30,089
<i>Every time I come back,<i>

437
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:32,158
I'm a bit less.

438
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:36,162
Pieces of you get chipped away.

439
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,966
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

440
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:45,604
Not 6 times.
Just once.

441
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,541
I don't think it works
that way, child.

442
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:57,117
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

443
00:29:57,151 --> 00:30:01,054
<i>He's at rest now, somewhere.<i>

444
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:03,489
I would never wish
my life upon him.

445
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,658
I would.

446
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:10,063
You're alive.

447
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:18,070
Lord, cast your light upon me.

448
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:22,475
Protect me in the darkness.

449
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:26,012
Burn away my sins.

450
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:29,282
Help me serve you.

451
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:31,485
Use me as you will.

452
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:36,557
For the night is dark

453
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:39,093
and full of terrors.

454
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:53,074
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

455
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,778
My lady.

456
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:59,647
I meant to come sooner.

457
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:02,917
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles, my king.

458
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:05,687
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

459
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:08,223
Yes, of course.

460
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:20,737
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

461
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,539
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

462
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:27,010
You are the one god's champion

463
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,279
and the finest man
I've ever known.

464
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:31,781
Selyse.

465
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,618
I've broken a sacred vow.

466
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:40,457
I've sinned.

467
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:43,627
- No.
- I've wronged you.

468
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:47,264
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

469
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,367
You don't understand.

470
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,075
The Red Woman--

471
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,545
the Lady Melisandre--

472
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,547
I know, Stannis.

473
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:06,618
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

474
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:09,888
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

475
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:12,691
can ever be a sin.

476
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:15,995
When she told me,

477
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:20,232
I wept with joy.

478
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:34,380
Oh, my sweet boys.

479
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:39,552
<i>Petyr, Tommard,<i>

480
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,588
<i>Edric.<i>

481
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,426
I thank god every day

482
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,497
<i>for bringing Melisandre to us.<i>

483
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,866
She gave you a son.

484
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,837
I gave you...

485
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:59,440
- <i>nothing.</i>
- That's not true.

486
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,880
So you've come
to see her as well?

487
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:11,250
There is no need.

488
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,220
You must keep away
from such distractions.

489
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,955
She's my daughter.

490
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,592
I want to see her.

491
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:25,932
You are a king.

492
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,768
You don't need my permission.

493
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,275
<i>Under the sea<i>

494
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,378
<i>I know, I know<i>

495
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:40,881
<i>Oh, oh, oh<i>

496
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:44,084
<i>The birds have scales<i>

497
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:46,987
<i>And the fish take wing<i>

498
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:50,090
<i>I know, I know<i>

499
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:53,059
<i>Oh, oh, oh...<i>

500
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,728
<i>Shireen.<i>

501
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:56,663
Father!

502
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,540
You've grown
since I last saw you.

503
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:10,078
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

504
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:11,680
Did you win?

505
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:14,983
No.

506
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:17,452
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

507
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:20,922
He did.

508
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,691
He fought bravely.

509
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,392
He hasn't come to visit me.

510
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:27,428
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

511
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,130
He won't be visiting, child.

512
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:31,698
Why not?
He's my friend.

513
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,300
Look.

514
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,508
He made this for me.

515
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:44,911
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

516
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:46,846
It's a secret.

517
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,549
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

518
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,021
Ser Davos is a traitor.

519
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,293
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

520
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,504
Best forget him.

521
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:25,186
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

522
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,654
What are you doing here?

523
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,022
I need a bath.

524
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,692
Help me out of these rags.

525
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,168
Now get out.

526
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,216
There's another tub.

527
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,185
This one suits me fine.

528
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,699
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

529
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:18,104
<i>If I faint, pull me out.<i>

530
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:21,173
I don't intend to be the first
Lannister to die in a bathtub.

531
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,975
Why should I care how you die?

532
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:25,978
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

533
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:29,681
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

534
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,151
Not going so well, is it?

535
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:35,820
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

536
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,966
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

537
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,968
You protected me
better than most--

538
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,738
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

539
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,609
I'm sick of fighting.

540
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:58,111
<i>Let's call a truce.<i>

541
00:36:58,145 --> 00:36:59,946
You need trust to have a truce.

542
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,617
I trust you.

543
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:13,495
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.<i>

544
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:15,998
I've seen it for 17 years

545
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,666
on face after face.

546
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,936
<i>You all despise me.<i>

547
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,704
Kingslayer.

548
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,907
Oathbreaker.

549
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:27,843
A man without honor.

550
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:35,016
You've heard of wildfire?

551
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,551
Of course.

552
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:39,354
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.<i>

553
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:41,923
He loved to watch people burn,

554
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:44,492
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

555
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:47,128
<i>and melted off their bones.<i>

556
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:49,331
<i>He burned lords he didn't like.<i>

557
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:51,433
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.<i>

558
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:54,902
He burned anyone
who was against him.

559
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:59,606
Before long, half the
country was against him.

560
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,011
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

561
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:10,550
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

562
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:13,019
<i>all over the city--<i>

563
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:15,321
beneath the Sept of Baelor

564
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:17,123
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

565
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:20,461
Under houses, stables, taverns.

566
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:23,831
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

567
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,969
Finally,

568
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:31,239
the day of reckoning came.

569
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,642
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

570
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:35,744
after his victory
at the Trident.

571
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:38,180
But my father arrived first

572
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,949
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

573
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:45,387
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

574
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:49,290
I knew my father
better than that.

575
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:52,660
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.<i>

576
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:55,263
<i>I told the Mad King as much.<i>

577
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:59,033
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

578
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:02,269
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.<i>

579
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:05,006
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

580
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,410
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

581
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,113
that grey, sunken cunt.

582
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:16,418
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

583
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:20,322
"The Lannisters
have always been

584
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:22,591
true friends
of the crown."

585
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,462
So we opened the gates

586
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:29,731
and my father sacked the city.

587
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:33,168
<i>Once again, I came to the king,<i>

588
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:36,371
begging him to surrender.

589
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,477
He told me to...

590
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:45,046
bring him my father's head.

591
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,449
Then he...

592
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:51,452
turned to his pyromancer.

593
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:54,254
"Burn them all," he said.

594
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:58,359
"Burn them in their homes.

595
00:39:58,393 --> 00:40:00,528
Burn them
in their beds."

596
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:06,669
Tell me, if your precious Renly

597
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:09,572
commanded you to kill
your own father

598
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:12,642
and stand by while
thousands of men,

599
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,911
women, and children
burned alive,

600
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,647
would you have done it?

601
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,482
Would you have
kept your oath then?

602
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:27,056
First, I killed the pyromancer.

603
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,693
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,<i>

604
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:34,230
I drove my sword into his back.

605
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,967
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.<i>

606
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,969
"Burn them all."

607
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,238
I don't think
he expected to die.

608
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,208
He-- he meant to...

609
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,245
burn with the rest of us

610
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:52,081
and rise again,

611
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,983
reborn as a dragon

612
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,918
to turn his enemies to ash.

613
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,259
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

614
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,133
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

615
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:13,368
If this is true...

616
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:16,872
why didn't you tell anyone?

617
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,742
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

618
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,277
Stark?

619
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:24,780
You think

620
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:28,751
the honorable Ned Stark

621
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:32,055
wanted to hear my side?

622
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,790
He judged me guilty

623
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,226
the moment he set eyes on me.

624
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,167
By what right does the wolf

625
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,202
judge the lion?

626
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,072
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

627
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,740
The Kingslayer!

628
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,077
Jaime.

629
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,113
My name is Jaime.

630
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:01,686
<i>Onion Knight.<i>

631
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,655
<i>Ser Onion Knight.<i>

632
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:07,325
Princess? Gods, what
are you doing here?

633
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,827
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

634
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:12,931
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

635
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,866
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

636
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,468
Go back to your room. You're
not supposed to be here.

637
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,637
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

638
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,906
Are you?

639
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,508
I am, child.

640
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,477
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

641
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,345
and now I'm paying the price.

642
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,881
I don't care.
You're my friend.

643
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,850
You must get bored down here.

644
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,819
I brought you
something to read.

645
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,688
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

646
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:40,157
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

647
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:41,959
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

648
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:44,295
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

649
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,698
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

650
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,601
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

651
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,036
but it's wasted on me.

652
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,538
Take it.
I have more.

653
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:57,275
My lady, I can't read
the words.

654
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,378
You can't?

655
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,114
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

656
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:03,982
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

657
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:06,151
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

658
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:08,954
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

659
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:16,929
I wouldn't know where to start.

660
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:18,697
At the beginning.

661
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,632
This word is Aegon.

662
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,770
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

663
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:26,705
it sounds like egg.

664
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,641
And the title of the whole book

665
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:30,843
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

666
00:43:30,877 --> 00:43:33,045
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."<i>

667
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,892
It was a
bitch of a siege.

668
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,095
Mm, you were first through
the breach at Pyke?

669
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:52,598
The second. Thoros of
Myr went in alone,

670
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,800
waving that
flaming sword of his.

671
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,536
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

672
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,506
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

673
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,408
Proudest moment of my life.

674
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:05,644
One knee in the dust, the
king's sword on my shoulder,

675
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,979
listening to the words.

676
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:10,716
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

677
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:13,687
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

678
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,624
In full plate
metal for 16 hours.

679
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,627
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

680
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:22,864
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

681
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,935
Robert would have laughed.

682
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:29,571
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

683
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:33,341
And a terrible king.

684
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:36,744
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

685
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,313
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

686
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:40,215
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

687
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:43,651
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

688
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:46,254
Just once in my life
before it's over,

689
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:49,324
I want to know what it's
like to serve with pride,

690
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,494
to fight for someone
I believe in.

691
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:54,295
Do you believe in her?

692
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:58,967
With all my heart.

693
00:45:04,106 --> 00:45:05,238
These are the ones?

694
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:07,529
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

695
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:45,814
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

696
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:47,448
when they are cut--

697
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:50,351
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

698
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:53,154
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--<i>

699
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:55,690
vermin.

700
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:44,322
<i>King Robert
wanted her dead.<i>

701
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:45,714
Of course he wanted her dead.

702
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:49,379
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

703
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:52,070
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

704
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,085
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

705
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,721
Doesn't the Lord Commander of
the Kingsguard traditionally--

706
00:46:57,756 --> 00:46:59,623
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

707
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:01,792
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

708
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:05,628
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

709
00:47:05,663 --> 00:47:07,597
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

710
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:09,532
Can't say I minded much.

711
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:12,735
I always hated the politics.

712
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,704
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

713
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:17,173
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

714
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,376
- and betrayals the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:25,448
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

716
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,684
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

717
00:47:27,718 --> 00:47:29,786
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

718
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,287
men with experience.

719
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:32,822
Which men do you have in mind?

720
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,858
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

721
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:38,462
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

722
00:47:38,496 --> 00:47:40,898
It suffered for a reason.

723
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:42,699
I sold men into slavery.

724
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,568
I don't know if your
presence by her side

725
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:46,870
will help our cause
when we go home.

726
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:48,705
Our cause?

727
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,774
Forgive me, Ser
Barristan, but I was busy

728
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:53,010
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

729
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:54,845
while you were still
bowing to the man.

730
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,881
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

731
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,517
You only joined us
a few days ago.

732
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:02,685
I can't speak
to your intentions.

733
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,854
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

734
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:07,690
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

735
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:10,326
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

736
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,928
You're not Lord Commander here.

737
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:15,531
You're just another exile.

738
00:48:15,565 --> 00:48:17,633
And I take my orders
from the queen.

739
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:28,643
- <i>Come to bed.</i><i>
- You were right.

740
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:31,613
The Karstarks are gone.

741
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,816
Almost half our forces.

742
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,353
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

743
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:41,256
Nothing.

744
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,425
Only wait.

745
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,961
Don't let him.

746
00:48:45,995 --> 00:48:48,096
What can I do?

747
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:49,564
Attack King's Landing?

748
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,733
There's nothing
he'd like better.

749
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,768
He'd crush us in a day.

750
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:55,937
We could ride north.

751
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:58,640
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.<i>

752
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:01,943
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last 5 years.

753
00:49:01,978 --> 00:49:03,344
Once my bannermen
are home again,

754
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:06,148
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

755
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:09,251
warm and safe, they'll
never ride south again.

756
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,420
When I gathered
my lords together,

757
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:13,356
we had a purpose, a mission.

758
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,158
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

759
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:20,430
Give them a new purpose.

760
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,165
What?

761
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:25,868
Oh, I don't know.

762
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:28,404
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

763
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:33,009
Here.

764
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:39,816
And we're here.
King's Landing--

765
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,225
What is it?

766
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:54,631
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

767
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:57,066
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

768
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,003
but I can attack them
where they're not.

769
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:04,040
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

770
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:08,345
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

771
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:11,782
Can you do it?

772
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:14,819
I need men to replace the
Karstarks who marched home.

773
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:17,455
There is only one person
in this kingdom

774
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,691
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

775
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:24,828
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

776
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:27,764
Walder Frey.

777
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,908
He's such a splendid fighter.

778
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:42,278
Do you have any idea
when we might...

779
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:45,949
I'll plant the seed as soon
as Joffrey and I are married.

780
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,450
It should grow quickly.

781
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:49,118
Joffrey won't let me leave.

782
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:51,888
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

783
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:55,258
And only one to let you go.

784
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:57,493
Because it will please me.

785
00:50:57,528 --> 00:50:59,562
<i>Squire!<i>

786
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:04,801
Well fought, ser.

787
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,603
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

788
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:09,972
Olyver, if it please you.

789
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:15,010
I should like to see you spar
with a proper partner, ser.

790
00:51:23,053 --> 00:51:24,586
How did you know?

791
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:26,522
Know what?

792
00:51:27,857 --> 00:51:29,692
That I wanted to.

793
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:31,593
My lord...

794
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:37,299
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

795
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,402
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

796
00:51:40,436 --> 00:51:43,539
They rarely do,
in my experience.

797
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:45,941
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

798
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:49,044
With the husbands.

799
00:51:57,888 --> 00:52:00,223
That didn't take long.

800
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:02,460
Well, it took long enough.

801
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:06,998
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

802
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:08,833
Is he?

803
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:11,168
And...

804
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:13,004
who's the lucky girl?

805
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:16,541
<i>She may not be
the grandest ship in the world<i>

806
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:19,043
or the fastest,

807
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:21,246
but she's mine.

808
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:26,718
I've always wanted a ship.

809
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,887
Now I want a dozen.

810
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:31,557
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

811
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,760
It doesn't matter what we want,

812
00:52:33,794 --> 00:52:35,595
once we get it,

813
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:37,364
then we want something else.

814
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:42,836
Your hair is different.

815
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,504
Is it?

816
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:46,139
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

817
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:48,575
Many ladies wear it this way.

818
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:50,344
I have good news.

819
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:52,479
I'll be leaving the city soon.

820
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:53,980
You still want me
to come with you?

821
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:56,216
It's not a question
of what I want.

822
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,452
It's what you want.

823
00:52:58,486 --> 00:52:59,686
You want to go home, don't you?

824
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,155
Of course.
More than anything.

825
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:07,727
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

826
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:10,564
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

827
00:53:10,598 --> 00:53:13,466
Not just for me, but for you.

828
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:14,767
You've been so kind.

829
00:53:14,802 --> 00:53:17,970
I'd feel terrible if
anything happened to you.

830
00:53:19,106 --> 00:53:21,340
I can't tell you
how touched I am

831
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:24,610
by your concern for my welfare.

832
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:27,447
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

833
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:29,515
Your true friend.

834
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,250
I do, Lord Baelish.

835
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:33,954
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

836
00:53:33,988 --> 00:53:36,089
If you wish to stay,

837
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:39,125
then of course you will stay.

838
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:46,399
We'll speak again
when I return.

839
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:01,546
<i>You're late.<i>

840
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,382
What's she doing here?

841
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,451
Our business concerns her, too.

842
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:08,319
<i>Sit.<i>

843
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:11,923
You'll be pleased to learn

844
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,026
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

845
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,094
I've saved the crown

846
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,931
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

847
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:20,999
Never mind that now.

848
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,553
We have something
important to discuss.

849
00:54:22,568 --> 00:54:25,003
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

850
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:27,339
Stop that.

851
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:29,307
You're making me uncomfortable.

852
00:54:29,342 --> 00:54:32,311
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

853
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:35,349
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

854
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:37,151
Very well.

855
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:39,219
She's a lovely girl.

856
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:41,254
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

857
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:43,090
but I'm sure they'll make do.

858
00:54:43,124 --> 00:54:45,659
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

859
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:48,795
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

860
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,299
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

861
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,001
Sansa is the key to the North?

862
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:56,403
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

863
00:54:56,437 --> 00:54:58,438
The Karstarks
have marched home.

864
00:54:58,473 --> 00:55:01,408
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

865
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:04,545
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.<i>

866
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:07,915
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

867
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,786
And I am not about to hand
her over to the Tyrells.

868
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:14,122
<i>The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.<i>

869
00:55:14,157 --> 00:55:16,925
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

870
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,760
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

871
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,597
<i>Plots are not public knowledge.<i>

872
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,365
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

873
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,567
until after Joffrey's wedding.

874
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:29,371
We need to act first and
kill this union in its crib.

875
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:30,806
And how do we do that?

876
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,107
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

877
00:55:33,142 --> 00:55:35,743
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

878
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:44,886
You can't mean it.

879
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,387
I can and I do.

880
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:49,524
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

881
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,593
since the day he took
her father's head.

882
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:54,662
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

883
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:56,397
That's cruel even for you.

884
00:55:56,432 --> 00:55:58,299
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

885
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:00,268
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

886
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,537
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

887
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:05,441
She's flowered, I assure you. She
and I have discussed it at length.

888
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,978
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

889
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:12,048
- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?

890
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,752
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

891
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:18,789
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

892
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:21,325
And it is past time
you were wed.

893
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,194
I was wed.

894
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,797
Or don't you remember?

895
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:30,367
Only too well.

896
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:33,771
<i>You should be
thanking the gods for this.<i>

897
00:56:33,805 --> 00:56:35,439
This is more than you deserve.

898
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:37,942
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.<i>

899
00:56:37,976 --> 00:56:40,044
As will you.

900
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,547
What do you mean?

901
00:56:43,582 --> 00:56:45,449
You'll marry Ser Loras.

902
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:50,054
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

903
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:52,557
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

904
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:55,327
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

905
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:58,063
You're still fertile. You need
to marry again and breed.

906
00:56:58,097 --> 00:57:00,265
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

907
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:02,968
You're my daughter!

908
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,637
You will do as I command

909
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,906
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

910
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,275
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

911
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:12,111
about you once and for all.

912
00:57:12,146 --> 00:57:14,247
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

913
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:16,817
Not another word.

914
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:19,919
My children.

915
00:57:19,954 --> 00:57:23,857
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.

916
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:38,404
<i>It's always summer<i>

917
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:41,808
<i>Under the sea<i>

918
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:44,711
<i>I know, I know<i>

919
00:57:44,745 --> 00:57:48,315
<i>Oh, oh, oh<i>

920
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:52,387
<i>The birds have scales<i>

921
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:56,024
<i>And the fish take wing<i>

922
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:59,061
<i>I know, I know<i>

923
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:02,698
<i>Oh, oh, oh<i>

924
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:06,168
<i>The rain is dry<i>

925
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:09,538
<i>And snow falls up<i>

926
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:12,341
<i>I know, I know<i>

927
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:16,011
<i>Oh, oh, oh<i>

928
00:58:16,046 --> 00:58:19,849
<i>The stones crack open<i>

929
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:24,086
<i>The water burns<i>

<i>The shadows come to dance<i>

00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,726
<i>My lord<i>

932

<i>The shadows come<i>

933
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:36,565
<i>To play<i>

934
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,469
<i>The shadows come to dance<i>

935
00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,671
<i> My lord<i>

936
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:46,141
<i>The shadows come<i>

937
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:02,678
<i>To stay.<i>
