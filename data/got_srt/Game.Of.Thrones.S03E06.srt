1
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,817
You've got too much
wood in there.

2
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:11,487
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,623
It needs to breathe.

4
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,592
<i>Take off that big log.</i>

5
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,473
Huh.
You know your fires.

6
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,985
Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

7
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,888
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

8
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:46,758
And there were
servants, of course.

9
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,061
I knew you were highborn.

10
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:56,468
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

11
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:00,685
Buried treasure.

12
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,222
Thousands of years old.

13
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,856
I think.

14
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,960
What does it do?

15
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,696
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

16
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,932
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

17
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:25,210
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

18
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,412
A few more days.

19
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:30,783
Is the Wall as big as they say?

20
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:32,685
Bigger.

21
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,923
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

22
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,959
It's hidden in clouds.

23
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:42,329
You're playing with me.

24
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:46,534
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

25
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:48,870
all made of ice.

26
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,573
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

27
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:59,481
Castle Black is nice enough.

28
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,851
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

29
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,620
day and night.

30
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:08,791
And Hobb makes venison stew

31
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,592
with onions.

32
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,027
Very tasty.

33
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:16,365
Sometimes, one of
the brothers will sing.

34
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,934
Dareon sings best.

35
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,069
- Do you sing?
- No.

36
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,905
No, no, no.
Not very well.

37
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,477
Sing me a song.

38
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:32,114
Oh, all right.

39
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,050
Let's see.

40
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh... ahem.

41
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:45,026
<i>The father's face
is stern and strong<i>

42
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:48,163
<i>He sits and judges
right from wrong<i>

43
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:51,466
<i>He weighs our lives,
the short and long<i>

44
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,736
<i>And loves
the little children<i>

45
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,673
<i>The mother gives</i>
<i>the gift of life</i>

46
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:02,476
<i>And watches over every wife<i>

47
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,848
<i>Her gentle smile
ends all strife<i>

48
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:10,618
<i>And she loves
her little children.<i>

49
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,760
That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

50
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,262
I know how to skin a rabbit.

51
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,631
Not by the looks of it.

52
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,748
You grow up north of the Wall,

53
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,617
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

54
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:45,086
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

55
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,690
If I had a bow, I could
have shot a dozen rabbits.

56
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,258
Well, I made this bow myself.

57
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,412
Guess you don't learn how to
do that north of the Wall.

58
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:54,561
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

59
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,630
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

60
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:58,132
I had someone else in mind.

61
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,633
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

62
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,136
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

63
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,005
Some of us are just
a little better.

64
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,007
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

65
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,109
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

66
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:11,078
Or don't they teach you to say
thank you north of the Wall?

67
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:14,748
You've got a big mouth,
girl, and too many teeth.

68
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,950
- Stop it!
- Hodor.

69
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,486
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

70
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,322
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

71
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:23,823
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

72
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:26,193
You've been nasty
to her every day.

73
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,627
Of course she's nasty back.

74
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,262
Me? It's my fault?

75
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:31,464
First time I met her, she
put a knife to my throat.

76
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,833
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

77
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,704
We can't fight each other.

78
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:40,007
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

79
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,776
I want you both to make peace.

80
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:53,955
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

81
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,591
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

82
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,762
You're a good little hunter.

83
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,230
Thank you.

84
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,698
See?

85
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,466
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

86
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,901
Don't push me.

87
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,313
Shh.

88
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,382
I'm right here with you.

89
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,350
What's happening?

90
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,553
I'm right here with you.

91
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,455
What's wrong with him?

92
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,661
The visions take their toll.

93
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:38,998
He's having one now?

94
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:01,186
I saw Jon Snow.

95
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:04,189
You saw him?

96
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:05,790
At Castle Black?

97
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,493
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

98
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,129
surrounded by enemies.

99
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:25,309
Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the Wall.

100
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,479
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

101
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:35,218
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

102
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,327
You ever climbed it before?

103
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,430
No.

104
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:48,400
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

105
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:56,209
You're afraid.

106
00:08:58,012 --> 00:09:00,446
- Aren't you?
- <i>Aye.</i>

107
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:03,216
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

108
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,619
But I've waited my whole life

109
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,654
to see the world from up there.

110
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,162
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

111
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,466
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

112
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,335
You kill someone for them?

113
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,537
Nah.

114
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,339
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

115
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:27,741
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

116
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:37,385
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

117
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,023
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

118
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:44,826
Can we not talk
about that here?

119
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,329
Can we not
talk about that here?

120
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,164
I'm Jon Snow.

121
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:51,200
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

122
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,336
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

123
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,871
Did I seem scared
the other day?

124
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:56,539
You were trembling like a leaf.

125
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:58,107
Only in the beginning.

126
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,511
Only in the beginning.

127
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,650
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

128
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:09,553
And don't worry.

129
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,655
Your secret's safe with me.

130
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,124
What secret?

131
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:17,627
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

132
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:21,597
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

133
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:24,567
You're loyal and you're brave.

134
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,439
You didn't stop being a crow

135
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:33,175
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

136
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:42,218
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

137
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:47,724
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

138
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:55,399
The Night's Watch don't
care if you live or die.

139
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:58,802
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

140
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,404
We're just soldiers
in their armies

141
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,740
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

142
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,951
It's you and me

143
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:16,054
that matters to me and you.

144
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,026
Don't ever betray me.

145
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,835
I won't.

146
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,938
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

147
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,274
and wear it 'round my neck.

148
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,852
Sink your metal deep

149
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,422
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

150
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:55,958
And if you fall,

151
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:57,727
don't scream.

152
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:01,398
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

153
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
<i>Joffrey.</i>

154
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,686
<i>Cersei.<i>

155
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,588
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

156
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,724
You're good.

157
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,065
You're not as good
as you think you are.

158
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,402
Face, tits, balls--

159
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,004
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

160
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,774
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

161
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:47,311
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

162
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,581
Show me your position.

163
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,152
Keep your elbow high.

164
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:59,155
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

165
00:13:01,124 --> 00:13:03,091
You're holding.

166
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,860
Never hold.

167
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,829
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

168
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:10,131
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

169
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,632
and release.

170
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,567
Never hold.

171
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,636
But I have to aim.

172
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,338
Never aim.

173
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,939
Never aim?

174
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:22,710
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

175
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,945
Trust your eye.

176
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,151
There's someone out there.

177
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:52,205
That's about far enough.

178
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,344
We come as friends.

179
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,179
<i>Begging</i>
<i>your pardon, m'lady,</i>

180
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,314
but we'll be the judge of that.

181
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,284
Valar morghulis.

182
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,353
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

183
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,159
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

184
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,929
<i>Why are you here, my lady?</i>

185
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:05,644
Forgive my manners.

186
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,680
I don't see many ladies
these days.

187
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,582
Lucky for the ladies.

188
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,146
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

189
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,015
6.

190
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,911
I've always been
a terrible priest.

191
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,815
Drank too much rum.

192
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,950
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

193
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,686
It's a terrible thing to say,

194
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,622
but by the time I came to Westeros,
I didn't believe in our Lord.

195
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,127
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

196
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,698
<i>were stories we told the
children to make them behave.</i>

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,470
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

198
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,573
but it was just for show.

199
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:46,312
A spectacle for the locals.

200
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:49,782
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

201
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,324
I knelt beside his cold body

202
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,159
and said the old words.

203
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,895
Not because I believed
in them, but...

204
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:07,168
he was my friend

205
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:09,504
and he was dead.

206
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,641
And they were
the only words I knew.

207
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:17,178
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

208
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,515
Beric's eyes opened

209
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,284
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

210
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,321
Our god is the one true god.

211
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,058
And all men must serve Him.

212
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,136
You've been to the other side.

213
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,139
The other side?

214
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:49,043
There is no other side.

215
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:52,746
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

216
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:59,554
He sent you to us for a reason.

217
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:03,358
You have someone He needs.

218
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,229
Bodkin point.

219
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:10,166
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

220
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:16,039
Can you make 'em?

221
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:18,441
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.

222
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:20,777
Just need decent steel.

223
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,111
I'll get you the steel.

224
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:24,381
<i>Come on.</i>

225
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,651
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

226
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:32,523
That's 'cause you're a girl.

227
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:34,291
What does that have
to do with anything?

228
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,165
Forgive me, lad.

229
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,038
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

230
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,707
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

231
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:52,541
He wants to be one of you.

232
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:54,843
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

233
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:57,045
We serve the Lord of Light

234
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,281
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

235
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:01,917
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

236
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:11,026
You're not doing this
for your god.

237
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,728
You're doing it for gold.

238
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,930
We're doing it for both, girl.

239
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,134
We can't defend the people
without weapons

240
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,436
and horses and food.

241
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:24,141
And we can't get weapons and
horses and food without gold.

242
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,110
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

243
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,613
You told me
I could be one of you.

244
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,256
You are more
than they can ever be.

245
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,158
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

246
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,828
You will make kings
rise and fall.

247
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,776
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

248
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,050
I see a darkness in you.

249
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,521
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

250
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,557
brown eyes,

251
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:15,861
blue eyes, green eyes.

252
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:19,064
Eyes you'll shut forever.

253
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:24,604
We will meet again.

254
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,551
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

255
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,329
You all right?

256
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,301
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

257
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,018
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

258
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,120
Wa--

259
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,192
Wa--? Wa--?

260
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:27,129
Water?

261
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,198
You want some water.

262
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,270
I wish I had some for you.

263
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:50,654
So let's play a game.

264
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:55,059
Which body part
do you need the least?

265
00:22:56,662 --> 00:23:00,131
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

266
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,467
I'll tell you everything,
please.

267
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,038
But you've already
told me everything.

268
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,574
<i>Remember?</i>

269
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:12,044
Your daddy was mean to you.

270
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:15,414
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

271
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,051
One good bit, though.

272
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:21,286
The Stark boys,

273
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,022
they're still alive.

274
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:29,159
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

275
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:33,130
You failed, but I'm a
better hunter than you.

276
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,867
<i>Now...</i>

277
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,869
how about your little finger?

278
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,738
You don't use that
for much, do you?

279
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:43,941
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

280
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:56,654
You've been wondering
why you're here.

281
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:59,190
<i>Haven't you?</i>

282
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:01,058
<i>Where you are.</i>

283
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,860
Who I am.

284
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:05,696
Why I'm doing this to you.

285
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:09,534
So guess.

286
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,803
<i>If you guess right,</i>

287
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:13,404
I'll tell you.

288
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:16,407
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

289
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:19,844
You win the game

290
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,946
if you can figure out who I am

291
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,514
and why I'm torturing you

292
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,884
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

293
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:32,557
If I win, you'll let me go?

294
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,361
If you think this has
a happy ending,

295
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:40,397
you haven't been
paying attention.

296
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,065
Please.

297
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,036
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

298
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:51,641
You first.

299
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,776
Where are we?

300
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:57,380
- The North.
- Too vague.

301
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,048
Deepwood Motte.

302
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,519
Terrible guess.

303
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:13,730
Now, where?

304
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,734
Last Hearth.

305
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:19,837
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

306
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,042
Karhold!

307
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,583
Karhold?

308
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,321
How did you know that?

309
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:42,760
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

310
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:44,394
No.

311
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,997
It was just a guess.

312
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:50,535
Very good, Lord Theon.

313
00:25:53,072 --> 00:25:54,472
And who am I?

314
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,675
Torrhen Karstark.

315
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,611
He's dead.

316
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,247
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

317
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:06,584
He was your brother.

318
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:15,359
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

319
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:27,136
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

320
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:32,808
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

321
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,776
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

322
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:38,413
That's why you're torturing me.

323
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,384
Yes.

324
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,556
You win.

325
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:01,603
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

326
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:05,140
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

327
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:13,549
I'm afraid I am.

328
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:18,754
Everything I told you is a lie.

329
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,261
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

330
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:28,031
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

331
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,302
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

332
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:39,043
I win.

333
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:41,746
Thank you for
riding here so quickly.

334
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,281
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

335
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:47,051
The roads are crawling with
cutthroats and bandits.

336
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:50,555
But when the King of the
North summons us, we come.

337
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,990
<i>Our father has
instructed us to tell you</i>

338
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:55,760
that his alliance
with the North can continue

339
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:58,463
if his terms are met.

340
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:01,432
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

341
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:03,468
for your violation
of your sacred oath

342
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:04,836
to marry one of his daughters.

343
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,972
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

344
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:10,441
As restitution
for this betrayal,

345
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:13,578
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

346
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:16,947
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

347
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:19,950
Harrenhal is not in the North.

348
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:23,654
It is his once the war is over

349
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:26,323
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

350
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:30,159
And there's something else.

351
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,995
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

352
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,599
Not what, whom.

353
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:40,003
What?

354
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:46,977
No.

355
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:49,246
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

356
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,215
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

357
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,084
How old is she?

358
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:54,352
19.

359
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:55,953
Could I see her first?

360
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,121
You want to count her teeth?

361
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:59,890
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

362
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,959
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

363
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:03,693
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

364
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:05,762
or this alliance is at an end.

365
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:08,365
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

366
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,067
Father is old.

367
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:13,102
It will put his heart at peace

368
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:16,004
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

369
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,874
And his recent experience
has made him wary

370
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:20,810
<i>of long engagements.</i>

371
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,645
He has every right to be.

372
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,981
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

373
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:46,102
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

374
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:49,206
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

375
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,674
I'm his liege lord.

376
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,909
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

377
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,911
I didn't wound him.

378
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,580
My answer is no.

379
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,552
Listen to me

380
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:05,556
and listen very carefully. You--

381
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,292
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

382
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,794
No man can compel
another man to marry.

383
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:13,397
The laws of my fist are
about to compel your teeth.

384
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:16,633
It's all right.
You heard him.

385
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,870
If you refuse, our alliance
with the Freys is dead.

386
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,306
He's wanted me for one of his
daughters since I was 12.

387
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,109
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

388
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:28,512
When I say no,
he will come back

389
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:30,547
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

390
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,416
You're willing to risk
our freedom

391
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,885
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

392
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,254
I have a war to fight.

393
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,289
We can't win it without them.

394
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,158
I have no time to haggle.

395
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:43,327
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

396
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:47,265
You recall that
heroic engagement?

397
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,206
I had something
less permanent in mind.

398
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,675
I've won every battle,

399
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,544
but I'm losing this war.

400
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:03,549
If we don't do this
and do it now,

401
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,651
we're lost.

402
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,925
I'll marry her.

403
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,861
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

404
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,731
It's not fair or right.

405
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:20,566
I'll remember it.

406
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:28,207
<i>I see my men
have finally found you</i>

407
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,309
<i>something appropriate to wear.</i>

408
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:34,246
Yes. Most kind of them.

409
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,347
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

410
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:39,017
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

411
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:41,052
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

412
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:44,688
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

413
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:46,323
If she wasn't his mother,

414
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,458
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

415
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,933
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

416
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,202
You should.

417
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:02,671
But instead,
you're sitting here

418
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:05,341
watching me fail at dinner.

419
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,543
Why might that be?

420
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,445
Wars cost money.

421
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,447
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

422
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:14,150
We both know
who would pay the most.

423
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,253
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

424
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:18,954
if he found out
you had captured me

425
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:21,223
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

426
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,626
You're right.

427
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,463
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

428
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,432
It would be,

429
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:32,769
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

430
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:35,471
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

431
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,840
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

432
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,043
He'll make time for you.

433
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,881
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

434
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,718
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

435
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:51,255
as restitution for the
mistakes my soldiers made.

436
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,658
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

437
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:57,228
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

438
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,670
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

439
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:12,210
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

440
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,680
Very well.

441
00:33:15,714 --> 00:33:17,749
My lady,

442
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:20,852
may our journey continue
without further incident.

443
00:33:20,886 --> 00:33:22,620
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

444
00:33:22,654 --> 00:33:25,356
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

445
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,158
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

446
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:30,327
I'm afraid I must insist.

447
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,029
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

448
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,198
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

449
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,068
about overplaying
your position.

450
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,208
- <i>Impossible.</i>
- Why?

451
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,577
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

452
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,747
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

453
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,383
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

454
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:57,153
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

455
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:00,189
and the mother of the king.

456
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:01,624
Old.

457
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:03,493
Old?

458
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:06,596
Old.

459
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,098
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

460
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,734
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

461
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:15,271
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

462
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,007
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

463
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,443
but this is another
matter entirely.

464
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:24,113
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

465
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,520
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

466
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:32,389
The only thing
that might turn it

467
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:36,126
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

468
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,362
- <i>Do you deny them?</i>
- Oh, not at all.

469
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,431
A sword swallower
through and through.

470
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:43,232
And a boy with his affliction

471
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:45,268
should be grateful
for the opportunity

472
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:48,337
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

473
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:50,238
and remove the stain
from his name.

474
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,508
Did you grow up with boy
cousins, Lord Tywin?

475
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,543
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

476
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,412
squires, stable boys?

477
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:59,747
Of course.

478
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,950
And you never...

479
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:05,019
No.

480
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,054
Not once?

481
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:08,656
Not in any way?

482
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,558
Never.

483
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:13,528
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

484
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:15,830
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

485
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,498
at each other
beneath the sheets.

486
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,101
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

487
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,036
for unnatural behavior.

488
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,504
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

489
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,807
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

490
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:29,010
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

491
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,781
brothers and sisters--

492
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,351
where I come from, that stain

493
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,854
would be very difficult
to wash out.

494
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,490
I will not breathe further life

495
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:43,926
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

496
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,563
Lie or not,

497
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,733
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

498
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:53,303
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

499
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:55,371
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

500
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:58,441
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

501
00:35:58,475 --> 00:36:00,543
I don't care
what people believe.

502
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,412
And neither do you.

503
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:07,016
As an authority
on myself, I must disagree.

504
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:11,221
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

505
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:14,157
then Joffrey is no king at all

506
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:18,361
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

507
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:22,099
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

508
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:26,303
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

509
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,874
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

510
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:32,443
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

511
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:35,680
All right.

512
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,248
I'll remove it for you.

513
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:41,084
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

514
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,987
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

515
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:47,456
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

516
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,491
He will never marry.

517
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:51,326
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

518
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,261
<i>The Tyrell name will fade.</i>

519
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,964
And Highgarden will go
to the children

520
00:36:55,998 --> 00:36:57,499
of Joffrey and Margaery.

521
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:00,002
You would have
your grandson protected

522
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,871
by someone who disgusts you?

523
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:05,508
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

524
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,879
who takes his vows seriously.

525
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:11,748
So, shall I draw up the order?

526
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:15,686
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

527
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:22,391
It's a rare enough thing--

528
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:26,329
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

529
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,514
No!

530
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:41,903
We've gotta cut them loose!

531
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,205
No!

532
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,453
Take my hand!

533
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,393
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

534
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:12,930
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

535
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:19,637
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

536
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,345
I'm very happy about...

537
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:30,180
Uh, yes.

538
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,382
I-I am as well.

539
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:36,720
I feel like I'm in a dream.

540
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:40,525
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

541
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,094
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

542
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:44,329
The guests,

543
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:47,532
the food, the tournaments.

544
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:53,139
And the bride, of course.

545
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:59,579
The most beautiful bride
in the world

546
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:01,213
in a beautiful gown of gold

547
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:03,816
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

548
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:08,488
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

549
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:11,257
No. I had never
left Winterfell

550
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:14,294
before I came
to King's Landing.

551
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:15,895
But it sounds wonderful.

552
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,531
I can't wait to see it.

553
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,667
And to leave this place.

554
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,537
It's terrible, isn't it?

555
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,542
The most terrible
place there is.

556
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:41,288
<i>I don't suppose there's
anything we can do about this.</i>

557
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:43,590
We can have them both killed.

558
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:47,360
It's hard to say
which of the 4 of us

559
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:50,397
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

560
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:52,365
Probably Sansa.

561
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,234
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

562
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:57,037
a deep and singular misery.

563
00:41:57,071 --> 00:41:59,807
Father doesn't discriminate.

564
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:02,677
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

565
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:04,812
On a boat you built.

566
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,883
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

567
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:10,453
I did what I did
to protect our family.

568
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,588
I'm your family.

569
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,558
A member of your family

570
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:18,628
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

571
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:21,463
Whether or not you or Father

572
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,499
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

573
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:25,835
I do admit it.

574
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:28,504
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

575
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:31,841
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

576
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,944
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

577
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:39,315
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

578
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,520
There are two people
in King's Landing

579
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:45,721
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

580
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,725
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

581
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:51,661
<i>to kill me during the
Battle of the Blackwater?</i>

582
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:03,672
The impulse I understand.

583
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,810
He hates me
because I'm the only one

584
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:10,713
who tells him
what he really is.

585
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:18,020
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

586
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:20,056
But his stupidity?

587
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,093
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

588
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:27,596
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

589
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:29,799
to murder the Hand of the King

590
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,734
in full view of his own army.

591
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:33,302
The boy's an idiot.

592
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,737
What do you want me to say?

593
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:37,773
I want you to tell me if my
life is still in danger.

594
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:39,542
Probably.

595
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,277
But not from Joffrey.

596
00:43:41,312 --> 00:43:43,479
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

597
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:47,751
Seven kingdoms united in fear

598
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:49,919
of Tywin Lannister.

599
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:52,322
Not the Tyrells.

600
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:54,391
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

601
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:55,859
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

602
00:43:55,893 --> 00:43:57,794
the little
doe-eyed whore.

603
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:00,830
And so will his children
and their children.

604
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:03,100
History will be taken
from our hands.

605
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,671
You may escape, at least.

606
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,339
Once Jaime gets back,

607
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,875
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

608
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,112
of sword through bowels.

609
00:44:15,146 --> 00:44:17,114
When Jaime gets back, yes.

610
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,816
But when do we think
that's going to be?

611
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,684
He's out there somewhere.

612
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:26,357
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

613
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:31,563
Who's going to tell her?

614
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:35,299
Do you think
people will like it?

615
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:37,835
I don't think they
will even notice it.

616
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:40,338
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

617
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,308
Anyway, from what I can tell,

618
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:45,510
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

619
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:47,111
to the ones in King's Landing.

620
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:50,481
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

621
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:54,385
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

622
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,287
I'm sure he does.

623
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:59,690
Will they let me
invite my family?

624
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:02,126
They haven't asked my opinion.

625
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,529
But do you think they will?

626
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,164
No.

627
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:14,805
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

628
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,675
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

629
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,078
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.

630
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:22,648
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

631
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:28,587
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

632
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:31,023
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

633
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,558
Of course.

634
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:35,261
Alone, if I may.

635
00:45:35,296 --> 00:45:36,996
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

636
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:38,832
Shae.

637
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:40,633
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.

638
00:45:40,668 --> 00:45:42,169
<i>She's not from here.</i>

639
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:43,403
But I trust her,

640
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:45,706
even though
she tells me not to.

641
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:51,212
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

642
00:45:51,246 --> 00:45:54,315
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

643
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:57,117
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

644
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,286
under entirely
different circumstances.

645
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,155
It's all right, really.

646
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:06,927
How to begin?

647
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:12,065
It's-- this--

648
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,736
this-- this is awkward.

649
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:19,806
1,000 blades

650
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:22,909
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

651
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:26,346
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

652
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,116
There aren't 1,000 blades.

653
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,718
There aren't even 200.

654
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,254
I've counted.

655
00:46:33,288 --> 00:46:35,923
Ha, I'm sure you have.

656
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:38,693
Ugly old thing.

657
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:41,829
Yet it has a certain appeal.

658
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:44,299
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

659
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,101
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

660
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:49,404
Early days, my friend.

661
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:52,373
It is flattering, really...

662
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:56,344
you feeling such dread

663
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,846
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

664
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:01,683
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

665
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:03,551
I promise you.

666
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:06,988
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

667
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:08,289
You're so right.

668
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:10,125
For instance,

669
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:11,860
when I thwarted your plan

670
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,962
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

671
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,097
If I'm going to be honest,

672
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:17,999
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

673
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:21,502
of enjoyment there.

674
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:24,138
But your confidant,

675
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:27,642
the one who fed you
information about my plans,

676
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:30,411
the one you swore to protect...

677
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:34,348
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

678
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:38,986
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

679
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:42,223
She was a bad
investment on my part.

680
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:47,061
Luckily, I have a friend

681
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:49,463
who wanted to try
something new.

682
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:53,000
Something daring.

683
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:56,837
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

684
00:47:56,872 --> 00:48:00,140
this fresh experience.

685
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,013
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

686
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,682
The realm?

687
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:12,117
Do you know what the realm is?

688
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,089
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

689
00:48:17,123 --> 00:48:22,061
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

690
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:24,563
till we forget that it's a lie.

691
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:29,168
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

692
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:31,137
Chaos.

693
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:33,873
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

694
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:37,443
Chaos isn't a pit.

695
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:39,845
Chaos is a ladder.

696
00:48:42,015 --> 00:48:44,516
<i>Many who try to climb it fail</i>

697
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:46,985
<i>and never get to try again.</i>

698
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:50,655
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

699
00:48:59,098 --> 00:49:02,800
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

700
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:05,302
<i>but they refuse.</i>

701
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:08,672
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

702
00:49:08,706 --> 00:49:10,707
<i>or the gods</i>

703
00:49:10,741 --> 00:49:13,176
<i>or love.</i>

704
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,445
<i>Illusions.</i>

705
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:19,415
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

706
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,752
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>
