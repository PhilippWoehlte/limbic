1
00:00:01,122 --> 00:00:03,427
<i>Our father has</i>
<i>instructed us to tell you</i>

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,100
that his alliance
with the North can continue

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,532
if his terms are met.

4
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:09,223
<i>Lord Frey requires</i>
<i>Lord Edmure</i>

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:11,546
<i>to wed one</i>
<i>of his daughters.</i>

6
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,143
It's hard to say
which of the 4 of us

7
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,836
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,065
<i>Probably Sansa.</i>

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,194
<i>Though Loras</i>
<i>will certainly come to know</i>

10
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,421
a deep and singular
misery.

11
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:21,696
<i>Who's going to tell her?</i>

12
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,152
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

13
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,115
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

14
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,444
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

15
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,873
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

16
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,969
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

17
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,636
<i>And you will swear</i>
<i>to tell your father</i>

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,735
<i>that I had nothing to do</i>
<i>with your maiming.</i>

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,902
- My lady.
- She won't be going with you.

20
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,703
Let's play a game.

21
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,505
Which body part
do you need the least?

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,225
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,373
6.

24
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:00,908
He sent you to us
for a reason.

25
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:02,608
You have someone
He needs.

26
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,142
You told me
I could be one of you.

27
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,808
<i>You told me</i>
<i>this was a brotherhood.</i>

28
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:07,809
You will make kings
rise and fall.

29
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,810
The visions
take their toll.

30
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:11,710
He's having one now?

31
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,911
- I saw Jon Snow.
- At Castle Black?

32
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:15,878
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall,

33
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:17,945
surrounded by enemies.

34
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:39,130
How far are we?

35
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,332
About a week, I think.

36
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,901
You think?
You don't know?

37
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:47,604
When we went to Castle Black,
we took the kingsroad.

38
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:50,339
You and your roads.

39
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,841
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

40
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:56,277
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

41
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:57,945
Most of the time, yes.

42
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,649
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

43
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:03,651
They don't, really.

44
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:07,722
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

45
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,825
And the drummers--
is that a great honor, too?

46
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,861
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

47
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,530
So what good are they?

48
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:18,967
- They help the men march.
- How?

49
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,571
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

50
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,107
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

51
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,142
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

52
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:30,346
You need help
remembering that?

53
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,616
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

54
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,120
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

55
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:39,222
No.

56
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,525
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

57
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:45,995
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

58
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,631
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

59
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,535
She's right, you don't.

60
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,840
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

61
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,608
Cut her loose, too.

62
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,676
Do you see her
sulking about it?

63
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,780
That's because she understands
the way things are.

64
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,385
And are you gonna
share it with me?

65
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,755
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

66
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,157
People work together
when it suits them.

67
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,859
They're loyal
when it suits them.

68
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,395
They love each other
when it suits them.

69
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,298
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

70
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,468
She knows that,
you don't.

71
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:29,905
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

72
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,390
That rain will cost us
another day.

73
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:52,795
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

74
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,997
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

75
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,399
Prickly?
That what you call it?

76
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,768
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

77
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:02,437
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

78
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,640
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

79
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,177
Apologies, Your Grace.

80
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:13,280
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

81
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,116
I've spent the last 2 years
nursing wounded men,

82
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,318
watching them
bleed and die.

83
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,387
I'm not afraid
of wet shits.

84
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,658
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

85
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,360
He can take it
as he likes.

86
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,496
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

87
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,164
He's getting a wedding.

88
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,500
It was a king he wanted.

89
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,536
<i>Edmure is the best match</i>
<i>a Frey has had</i>

90
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,439
in the history
of their house.

91
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,207
We should all
get some sleep.

92
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,888
If you don't put
some clothes on,

93
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:02,424
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

94
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,659
Attack. Attack.

95
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,618
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

96
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:31,054
My mother.

97
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:35,625
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

98
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,460
Gaaa?

99
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,403
Say hello for me.

100
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,772
<i>Rytsas.</i>

101
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:52,009
<i>"Ritsas."</i>

102
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,044
That was close enough.

103
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,717
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

104
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:01,853
Not yet.

105
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,191
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

106
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,829
Many surprises for her.

107
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,503
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

108
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,839
when you're over there
looking like that?

109
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:27,046
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

110
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,649
<i>When all this is over?</i>

111
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,918
I will.

112
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:34,321
I promise.

113
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:42,029
<i>I know she'd love</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

114
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,165
And her grandchild.

115
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,971
What, now?

116
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:58,045
Are you certain?

117
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:02,216
Are you angry with me?

118
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,018
Angry?

119
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,423
You're my queen.

120
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,963
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

121
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,500
Maybe one of each.

122
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,535
Don't get greedy.

123
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,780
Can you leave the war
for one night?

124
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,185
I love you.

125
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:42,090
Do you hear me?

126
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:44,626
I love you.

127
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,710
Most men fuck like dogs.

128
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,347
No grace, no skill.

129
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,416
A few dozen thrusts
and done.

130
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,552
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

131
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,854
Your cock shouldn't
go near her

132
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:17,190
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

133
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:19,959
And then you go inside,

134
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:21,628
<i>but slowly.</i>

135
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:25,098
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

136
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,700
Come on!

137
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:30,170
Hey, come on.

138
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:44,484
You think he loves you,
is that it?

139
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,354
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

140
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:49,857
and live with you
in some castle?

141
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,526
No, he didn't
tell me anything.

142
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,295
He barely talks.

143
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,531
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

144
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,733
giggling like
a pair of girls.

145
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,634
What, you're jealous?

146
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,570
Of course I'm jealous.

147
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:04,438
You should be
with one of your own.

148
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,273
And you're one of my own?

149
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,067
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

150
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:11,277
You would
if you were mine.

151
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,981
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

152
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:19,352
and fierce and wild.

153
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:21,520
I'd be good to you.

154
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,458
You love him?

155
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,633
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

156
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,770
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

157
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,573
You think pretty
is gonna make you happy?

158
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,441
Don't touch me.

159
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,645
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

160
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:53,785
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

161
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,956
to come here
to the capital.

162
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,625
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

163
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,129
and King's Landing
after dark--

164
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,667
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

165
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,837
I'm stupid.

166
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,340
A stupid little girl

167
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:18,343
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

168
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,311
Come on.

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,215
Come walk with me.

170
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,919
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

171
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:32,222
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

172
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,691
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

173
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,860
and so does my grandmother.

174
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,898
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

175
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,466
But women in our position

176
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:46,503
must make the best
of our circumstances.

177
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:49,540
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

178
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,842
I have to marry him.

179
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:56,881
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

180
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,417
Has he been kind to you?

181
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,719
He's tried.

182
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,220
You don't want
him, though.

183
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:04,555
He's a Lannister.

184
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,191
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

185
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:10,428
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,297
Here I am
complaining to you...

187
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,900
My son will be king.

188
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,402
Sons learn
from their mothers.

189
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,337
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

190
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:23,174
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

191
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:27,145
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

192
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,047
and the North someday.

193
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,351
What?

194
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:35,853
My son...

195
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,988
with him.

196
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,760
I'll have to--

197
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,729
we'll have to--

198
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,698
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

199
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,933
I'm not afraid
of the pain.

200
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,069
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

201
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,704
What is it, then?

202
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:57,242
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

203
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,478
Especially with the scar.

204
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,913
He's a dwarf.

205
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,149
And Loras--

206
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,951
Loras.

207
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,190
Some women like tall men.

208
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:12,859
Some like short men.

209
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:15,662
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

210
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:18,898
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

211
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,301
pretty girls.

212
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:24,404
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

213
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:28,074
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

214
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,376
before we're old and gray.

215
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,446
Tyrion may surprise you.

216
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:37,183
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

217
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:40,453
And that's a good thing?

218
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:41,888
<i>It can be.</i>

219
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,690
We're very complicated,
you know.

220
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,059
Pleasing us
takes practice.

221
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,495
How do you know
all this?

222
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,930
Did your mother teach you?

223
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:56,969
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

224
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,476
<i>She's a child.</i>

225
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,044
<i>She's a foot</i>
<i>taller than you.</i>

226
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,879
A tall child.

227
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:07,948
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

228
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,483
Not that young.

229
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,752
How much older?

230
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,521
Older.

231
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,658
You're a lord,
she's a lady.

232
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,526
And a beauty at that.

233
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,094
I don't see the problem.

234
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,397
Shae isn't going
to like it.

235
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,165
Shae is a whore.

236
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,802
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

237
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,905
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

238
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,875
I should never have
told you about that.

239
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,278
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

240
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:39,482
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

241
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:41,384
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

242
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,619
You can rule the North
in his name.

243
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,422
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

244
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,291
Two women to despise me

245
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,626
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

246
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,464
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

247
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:58,267
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

248
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:04,374
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

249
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:07,009
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

250
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:10,947
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

251
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:13,817
The ones already there
don't need company.

252
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,419
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

253
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,324
Evil notions come free.

254
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,390
Your Grace.

255
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,526
Grandfather.

256
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,862
You wanted
to speak to me?

257
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,663
Yes.

258
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:05,701
I'd like a report on the meetings
of my small council.

259
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,804
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

260
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,040
of your small council,
Your Grace.

261
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,542
Any or all of them.

262
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:13,411
I've been very busy.

263
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:16,047
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

264
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:18,249
Of course.

265
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:21,819
You've been holding
the council meetings

266
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:25,422
in the Tower of the Hand instead of
the small council chamber.

267
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,124
I have, yes.

268
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,161
May I ask why?

269
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:33,197
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

270
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:36,400
To walk from there
to here would take time,

271
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:39,103
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

272
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:41,505
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

273
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,409
I would now have to climb
all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

274
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:03,728
We could arrange
to have you carried.

275
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,033
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

276
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:12,102
in the east
and her dragons.

277
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,771
Where did you hear
about this?

278
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,273
Is it true?

279
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:18,375
Apparently so.

280
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:24,647
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

281
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,383
When I was
Hand of the King

282
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,652
under your father's
predecessor,

283
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,288
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

284
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:34,756
were kept in this room.

285
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,526
The skull
of the last of them

286
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,595
was right here.

287
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:44,065
It was the size
of an apple.

288
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,069
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

289
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:50,872
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

290
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:54,075
died 300 years ago.

291
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,711
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

292
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:58,079
are no threat to us.

293
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,516
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

294
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:04,586
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

295
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,589
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

296
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,758
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

297
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,726
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

298
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,195
But I haven't
been counseled.

299
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,899
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

300
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,138
I should be consulted
about such things.

301
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,673
From now on,
I will see to it

302
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,775
that you are
appropriately consulted

303
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,077
on important matters

304
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,213
whenever necessary.

305
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:38,720
Your Grace.

306
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,767
Yunkai.

307
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,868
The Yellow City.

308
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,975
<i>The Yunkish train</i>
<i>bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

309
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,044
We can defeat them.

310
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:07,513
On the field,
with ease.

311
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:09,282
But they won't
meet us on the field.

312
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,485
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

313
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,988
<i>If they're wise,</i>
<i>they'll hide behind those walls</i>

314
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:17,724
and chip away at us,
man by man.

315
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:21,728
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

316
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,998
We don't need
Yunkai, khaleesi.

317
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,702
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

318
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,004
or the Iron Throne.

319
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,109
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

320
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:39,114
200,000,
if not more.

321
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:43,151
Then we have 200,000 reasons
to take the city.

322
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,984
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

323
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:29,455
of that ancient
and honorable house,

324
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,824
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

325
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:35,461
<i>to offer terms of peace.</i>

326
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:37,763
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

327
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:40,666
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

328
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,335
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

329
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,537
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

330
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,907
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

331
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:53,145
You may approach.
Sit.

332
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,855
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

333
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,870
Ancient and glorious
is Yunkai.

334
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,538
Our empire was old

335
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,608
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

336
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:27,911
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

337
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:30,681
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

338
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,054
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

339
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:39,056
I was told
to blood them early.

340
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:43,261
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

341
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,031
But why?

342
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:49,400
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

343
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:53,638
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

344
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,511
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

345
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,179
for the silver queen.

346
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:11,590
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

347
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,658
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

348
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:16,495
As I said,
we are a generous people.

349
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,198
<i>You shall have</i>
<i>as many ships as you require.</i>

350
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:21,300
And what do you ask
in return?

351
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:25,537
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

352
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:28,073
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

353
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:30,976
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

354
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:36,249
I have a gift
for you as well.

355
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,652
- Your life.
- My life?

356
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:41,387
And the lives
of your wise masters.

357
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,991
But I also want
something in return.

358
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:48,595
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

359
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:51,698
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

360
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:53,533
clothing, and property
as they can carry

361
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,870
as payment
for their years of servitude.

362
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:58,938
Reject this gift,

363
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,340
and I shall
show you no mercy.

364
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,376
You are mad.

365
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,211
<i>We are not Astapor</i>
<i>or Qarth.</i>

366
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:08,447
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

367
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:12,218
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

368
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:15,221
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

369
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:17,590
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

370
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:22,361
You swore me
safe conduct.

371
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:26,265
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

372
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,834
And you threatened
their mother.

373
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,037
Take the gold.

374
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,549
My gold.
You gave it to me, remember?

375
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,351
And I shall put it
to good use.

376
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:48,220
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

377
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,956
Now get out.

378
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:56,629
The Yunkish
are a proud people.

379
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:58,231
They will not bend.

380
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:01,234
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

381
00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:03,303
He said he had
powerful friends.

382
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,138
Who was he talking about?

383
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,440
I don't know.

384
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,876
Find out.

385
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:27,327
Chains?

386
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,598
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

387
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,801
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

388
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,236
Golden chains.

389
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,874
You could buy
a ship with these.

390
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,642
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

391
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:44,480
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

392
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:48,617
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

393
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,088
I didn't ask
for this marriage.

394
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,625
- I didn't want it.
- No?

395
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,961
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

396
00:27:57,995 --> 00:28:00,030
That doesn't mean that--

397
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:02,265
this is duty,
not desire.

398
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,868
Is that what you will tell yourself
when you fuck her?

399
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:07,004
I don't have a choice.
My father--

400
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,640
Does not rule
the world.

401
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:15,380
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

402
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,248
What would I do there?

403
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:19,016
Juggle?

404
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:22,153
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

405
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,788
And I'm Shae
the funny whore.

406
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:28,692
My feelings for you
have not changed.

407
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:31,928
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

408
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,197
While I empty
her chamber pot

409
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,999
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

410
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:38,534
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

411
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:41,370
No?
What will it be like?

412
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:46,775
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

413
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,978
You will have
fine clothes,

414
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:51,781
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

415
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:56,253
Any children
we might have

416
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:58,221
will be
well provided for.

417
00:28:58,256 --> 00:29:00,623
Children?
You think I want children

418
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,292
who can never see
their father?

419
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,893
Who would be killed
in their sleep

420
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:06,229
if their grandfather
found out about them?

421
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,130
Listen.

422
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,432
Listen to me, my lady.

423
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,801
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

424
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,071
You'll always
be my lady.

425
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:22,310
I'm your whore.

426
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,680
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

427
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:27,815
I will be nothing.

428
00:29:57,578 --> 00:30:00,247
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

429
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,417
I should have been here.

430
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,321
After all the running
and fighting,

431
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:10,224
here I am,
back where I started.

432
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,493
Do you miss it?

433
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:15,495
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

434
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,432
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

435
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:22,035
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

436
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,837
Your talent for fighting?

437
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:25,372
I'm lowborn.

438
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,641
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

439
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,509
Mine was a slave.

440
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,545
So was I.

441
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,581
Bought and sold,

442
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,583
scourged and branded,

443
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,885
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

444
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,020
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

445
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:43,424
I was born in Flea Bottom.

446
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,893
Your blood is noble.

447
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:50,198
Are you saying my father,

448
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:52,734
he was some lord or...

449
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,035
There.

450
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,304
Your father's house.

451
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,713
I'm just a bastard.

452
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:10,019
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

453
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,321
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

454
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,123
and the First Men.

455
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:17,827
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

456
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,997
There is power
in a king's blood.

457
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,347
Come sit
by the fire, child.

458
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,484
Not talking, eh?

459
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,687
That's a first.

460
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,055
I don't talk
to traitors.

461
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,226
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

462
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:54,928
But you did.

463
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:58,131
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

464
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:02,168
The Red God
is the one true god.

465
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:04,637
You've seen his power.

466
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:06,872
When he commands,
we obey.

467
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,909
He's not
my one true god.

468
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:14,446
No?
Who's yours?

469
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,717
Death.

470
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,431
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

471
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,934
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

472
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,604
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

473
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,210
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

474
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:44,280
Yeah!

475
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:47,450
But what about Riverrun?

476
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,318
It's not south.
It's west of here.

477
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:51,554
It will still be west of here
2 days from now.

478
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,724
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

479
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,926
But we need
to do this first.

480
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,828
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

481
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,396
I swear to you,
this isn't--

482
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,066
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

483
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,734
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

484
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,138
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

485
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:11,208
One day you'll understand,
but now--

486
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:16,747
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

487
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:43,039
Kick all you like,
wolf girl.

488
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:45,542
Won't do you no good.

489
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:04,727
I thought you were gone.

490
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,896
Tomorrow.

491
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:13,235
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

492
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,806
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

493
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,976
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

494
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:23,412
You're to remain here.

495
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,915
With Locke?

496
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,892
I owe you a debt.

497
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,697
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

498
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:43,434
we both made
a promise to her.

499
00:34:43,468 --> 00:34:45,435
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

500
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,171
You gave your word.

501
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,772
Keep it

502
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,775
and consider
the debt paid.

503
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,845
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

504
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,115
I swear it.

505
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:08,090
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

506
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:30,248
Here.
Let me.

507
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,558
It will take time.

508
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:47,332
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

509
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:49,101
<i>to give him back</i>
<i>his chain.</i>

510
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:51,003
My father will make him
Grand Maester

511
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:53,505
if he grows me
a new hand.

512
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,443
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

513
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:02,515
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

514
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,718
The Lannisters send
their regards.

515
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,993
Safe journey,
Kingslayer.

516
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:15,296
Nothing to say?

517
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,732
I liked you
better before.

518
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:21,068
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

519
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:24,004
And don't you worry
about your friend.

520
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:27,174
We'll take
good care of her.

521
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,660
Shh.

522
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:12,851
Gentle, my lord.

523
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:15,086
Gentle.

524
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:26,665
Shh shh shh.

525
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:29,368
Myranda knows
what she's doing.

526
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:31,070
Let her.

527
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:34,373
She trained
as a septa, only...

528
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:38,677
she had other urges.

529
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:42,548
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

530
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,618
Where is he?

531
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:47,152
Who, my lord?

532
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:50,723
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

533
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:53,325
Please.

534
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,561
Don't you want us
to see it?

535
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:57,630
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

536
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,899
Everybody talks about it.

537
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,936
He sent you.

538
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,470
Who sent us?

539
00:38:04,505 --> 00:38:06,573
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

540
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:08,542
We heard so much
about it.

541
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:12,880
- Please.
- Oh!

542
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:15,450
There it is.

543
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,187
Oh.

544
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:21,890
Do you think
we're ugly?

545
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,958
He thinks we're ugly.

546
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:25,894
Well, he's been
through so much.

547
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,330
Look at his poor face.

548
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,333
Help me.

549
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:34,836
If he comes back...

550
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:39,675
We need to make him
feel better.

551
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:42,678
And how can we make
him feel better?

552
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:45,414
I have an idea.

553
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:08,571
Oh, she's shy.

554
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:12,608
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

555
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,812
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

556
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:30,425
Oh.

557
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,394
I felt something.

558
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:38,534
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

559
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:43,506
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

560
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,551
And why should you
get all the fun?

561
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:08,731
What?
You like her better?

562
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,571
Plenty there
for both of us.

563
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,775
I was here first.

564
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,217
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

565
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,319
Terrible timing.

566
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,024
But I was getting jealous.

567
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,730
Well?

568
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:46,301
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

569
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:01,350
Everyone knows
you love girls.

570
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,321
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

571
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:17,936
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

572
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,940
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

573
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:28,280
Please.

574
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:31,249
No.

575
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:33,352
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

576
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,354
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

577
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:38,157
This is mercy.

578
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,392
I'm not killing you.

579
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:44,497
<i>Just making</i>
<i>a few alterations.</i>

580
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,102
No! No! No!

581
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,938
Please, no! No!

582
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:54,341
No! No, please!
Please!

583
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:58,578
You're gonna scare it off.

584
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:01,481
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

585
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:04,884
It's too far away.

586
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:29,974
Is that a palace?

587
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:34,445
It's a windmill.

588
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:37,215
Windmill.

589
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:40,752
Who built it?
Some king?

590
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:43,121
Just the men
who used to live here.

591
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,756
<i>They must have been</i>
<i>great builders,</i>

592
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,025
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

593
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,128
Winterfell has towers
3 times that size.

594
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:53,064
I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

595
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:54,265
My daddy
was a fancy lord

596
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,235
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds.

597
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,238
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

598
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:02,241
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

599
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:04,110
What's swooning?

600
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:05,945
Fainting.

601
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,514
What's fainting?

602
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:13,386
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

603
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:15,589
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

604
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:18,458
Well...

605
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:20,693
not all girls
are like you.

606
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:23,897
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

607
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,000
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

608
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,768
Oh, a spider!

609
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:32,337
Save me, Jon Snow.

610
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:34,673
My dress is made
of the purest silk

611
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:37,075
from Tralalalaleeday.

612
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:39,677
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

613
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:44,315
Would you?

614
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:49,321
So I could
tear it off you.

615
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:52,290
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

616
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:54,459
I'll blacken your eye.

617
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,235
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Winterfell.

618
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:08,206
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

619
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,541
After we've taken
our land back.

620
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:15,346
Ygritte.

621
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:20,586
You won't win.

622
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:24,423
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

623
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:27,660
- You know nothing--
- 6 times in the last thousand years,

624
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:29,963
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

625
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:33,634
- 6 times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

626
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:35,569
Every boy in the North
knows it.

627
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:37,038
We grow up learning it.

628
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:38,439
Where the battles
were fought,

629
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:40,207
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

630
00:44:40,241 --> 00:44:42,109
6 times you've invaded

631
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:45,312
and 6 times
you've failed.

632
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:47,347
The seventh
will be the same.

633
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:50,583
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

634
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:54,186
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

635
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,621
You don't know
how to fight together.

636
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:58,157
- You don't know that.
- I do.

637
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,958
I know it.

638
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,327
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

639
00:45:02,361 --> 00:45:04,262
All of you.

640
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,539
All of <i>us.</i>

641
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:32,491
You're mine

642
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:35,060
as I'm yours.

643
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:37,629
And if we die,
we die.

644
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,133
But first we'll live.

645
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:45,137
Yes, first we'll live.

646
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:04,256
What's he going on about?

647
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,659
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

648
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:08,761
while we do all the work?

649
00:46:11,698 --> 00:46:13,333
Hodor.

650
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:18,539
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

651
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:20,274
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

652
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:22,275
You think I can't
hear you every day?

653
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,944
Filling his head
with black magic.

654
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:26,980
<i>Talking about visions</i>
<i>and three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

655
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:29,850
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

656
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:31,585
I don't fill his head
with anything.

657
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,154
<i>So what do you</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

658
00:46:34,189 --> 00:46:37,290
What's happening to him
and what that means.

659
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:39,892
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

660
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:41,494
It's not like that.

661
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:43,295
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

662
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,698
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

663
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:48,500
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

664
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:50,002
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

665
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:52,971
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

666
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:56,507
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

667
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:58,242
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

668
00:46:58,277 --> 00:46:59,911
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

669
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:03,014
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

670
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,551
Look at me.

671
00:47:07,886 --> 00:47:09,854
The raven's
been coming to me

672
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,257
ever since I fell
from that tower.

673
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,060
He wants me
to find him.

674
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:18,463
I don't have
my legs anymore.

675
00:47:18,498 --> 00:47:20,399
This is what I have now.

676
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:22,601
You have a family.

677
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:24,469
You need to go back
to Castle Black

678
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:27,272
so you can get back to them
where you belong.

679
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:30,276
What if I belong
in the North?

680
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,613
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

681
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:36,849
Is that what
he's telling you?

682
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:39,051
That it's all
for a reason?

683
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:43,289
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

684
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:45,291
I wish it were true,
little lord.

685
00:47:45,326 --> 00:47:49,496
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

686
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,798
You don't understand.
You don't know.

687
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,800
You don't know.
None of you know.

688
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:56,069
None of you
have been up there.

689
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:01,507
I had a man once.

690
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,276
A good man.

691
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,078
Bruni, his name was.

692
00:48:05,113 --> 00:48:08,115
I was his
and he was mine.

693
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:11,117
But one night
Bruni disappears.

694
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:13,753
People said he left me,

695
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:15,121
but I knew him.

696
00:48:15,155 --> 00:48:19,091
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

697
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,494
I knew he'd come back.

698
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:25,264
And he did.

699
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,669
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

700
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:32,506
Only it wasn't Bruni.

701
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,108
Not really.

702
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:38,679
His skin was pale

703
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:42,082
like a dead man's.

704
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:44,952
His eyes bluer
than clear sky.

705
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:50,459
<i>He came at me,</i>

706
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,461
grabbed me by the neck

707
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:55,331
and squeezed so hard

708
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,201
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

709
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,939
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

710
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,876
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

711
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,612
deep into his heart.

712
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,551
And he hardly
seemed to notice.

713
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:20,257
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

714
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,395
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

715
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:29,165
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

716
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,368
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

717
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,671
<i>Not anymore.</i>

718
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:39,243
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

719
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:41,845
and no further.

720
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,988
How is the pain,
my lord?

721
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:58,093
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

722
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:04,632
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

723
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:07,469
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

724
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,571
You're a learned man.

725
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,206
All the good
it's done me.

726
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,408
You did well
sewing up this mess.

727
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:15,777
You're far better
at this sort of work

728
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,480
than Grand Maester
Pycelle.

729
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,116
Faint praise, my lord.

730
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,955
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

731
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,956
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

732
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,260
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

733
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,030
What is?

734
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,834
Curiosity.

735
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:42,838
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

736
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:45,140
And the only way
to understand it

737
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,543
is to study the afflicted.

738
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,246
You performed experiments
on living men.

739
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,148
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

740
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:55,219
My studies
have given me insight

741
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,921
that has saved
many lives.

742
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:59,323
Dying paupers,
I assume.

743
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:02,926
Men with no families
to complain.

744
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,762
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

745
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:07,231
and had them carted
back to your garret

746
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:10,534
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

747
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:13,003
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

748
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:14,672
I don't know.

749
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:17,842
50? 100?

750
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:21,680
Countless.

751
00:51:21,714 --> 00:51:23,716
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

752
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,052
And how many lives
have you saved?

753
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,921
Half a million.

754
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:32,358
The population
of King's Landing.

755
00:51:37,465 --> 00:51:40,967
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

756
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:45,204
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

757
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,840
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

758
00:51:49,075 --> 00:51:51,443
Lord Selwyn Tarth

759
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:55,180
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

760
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:59,051
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

761
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,622
Why not?

762
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:04,023
He's convinced Lord Tarth

763
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,759
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

764
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,497
He feels
he's being cheated.

765
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:12,700
They'd be fools
to kill her.

766
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:15,169
These men have been
at war a long time.

767
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:17,371
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

768
00:52:17,406 --> 00:52:20,341
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

769
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,610
Beyond tonight,

770
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:24,912
I don't think
they care very much.

771
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:46,467
We have to return
to Harrenhal.

772
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:47,934
Why?

773
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,436
I've left
something behind.

774
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,071
Absolutely not.

775
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,073
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

776
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:54,641
And what are those orders?

777
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,178
To deliver you to your father
at King's Landing.

778
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,447
You think you'll get
a reward.

779
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:05,251
I serve Lord Bolton.

780
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:06,819
Any appreciation
your father--

781
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,187
You think
you're getting a reward.

782
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:09,521
Let me explain
something to you.

783
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:11,556
When my father sees me,
the first thing

784
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,958
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

785
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:16,841
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

786
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:17,581
I had nothing--

787
00:53:17,606 --> 00:53:20,456
Or I could tell him
this man saved my life.

788
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:25,370
We return
to Harrenhal now.

789
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,924
Whoa.

790
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:50,829
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

791
00:53:55,468 --> 00:53:59,038
<i>The bear, the bear</i>
<i>and the maiden fair</i>

792
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:01,107
<i>From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to ther</i>

793
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,476
<i>All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair</i>

794
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,878
<i>He smelled that girl
in the summer air<i>

795
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,114
<i>The bear, the bear,
and the maiden fair!<i>

796
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,620
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

797
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:17,189
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

798
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:22,461
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

799
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:24,129
Stop running and fight.

800
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,206
A wooden sword?

801
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,043
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

802
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,845
We've only got
one bear.

803
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:39,513
I'll pay
her bloody ransom.

804
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:41,515
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

805
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,150
Just get her
out of there.

806
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:45,552
All you lords and ladies

807
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:48,488
still think that the only thing
that matters is gold.

808
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:51,925
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

809
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,028
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

810
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:57,464
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

811
00:54:57,498 --> 00:55:00,133
and fuck yourself
with it.

812
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:12,679
Ah!

813
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,553
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

814
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:33,899
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

815
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,834
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

816
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:38,903
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

817
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:44,341
Pull her up.

818
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,455
Hold my legs.

819
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:23,912
Pull him up!

820
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,325
The bitch stays.

821
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,829
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

822
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:42,497
Unless you kill me.

823
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,735
She belongs to me.

824
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:49,671
Lord Bolton's orders.

825
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:52,474
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

826
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:54,209
Getting his pet rat
a reward

827
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:57,579
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

828
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:20,871
Well, we must
be on our way.

829
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:26,577
Sorry about
the sapphires.
