1
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:06,779
Reject this gift and I
shall show you no mercy.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,905
- You are mad.
- It was just as you said.

3
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:13,541
Their slave soldiers threw down
their spears and surrendered.

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:16,662
- <i>The bitch stays.</i>
- I'm taking her to King's Landing.

5
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:18,025
Unless you kill me.

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,297
Well, we must be on our way.

7
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,600
- Please.
- I'm not killing you.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,478
Just making a few alterations.

9
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,266
No! Don't!

10
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:30,447
The Nightfort's
closest to Castle Black.

11
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,384
It's got a secret
sally port, the Black Gate,

12
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,837
as old as the Wall itself.

13
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:37,862
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort.

14
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:40,498
- Stop.
- But your father--

15
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:43,698
I won't share your bed.
Not until you want me to.

16
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:45,685
What if I never want you to?

17
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:49,442
And so my watch begins.

18
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:53,146
He's a crow. He'll stab us in
the back first chance he gets.

19
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,055
Kill him.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,872
The wolves are out there.
You're a warg, Bran. Do it.

21
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:12,861
I'm going beyond the Wall.
It won't be safe for Rickon.

22
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:14,343
I'm coming with you.

23
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:17,179
You and Osha and
Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.

24
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,423
- She's just going to kill him.
- Sacrifice him.

25
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,815
The boy's your nephew.

26
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:22,512
The usurper Robb Stark...

27
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,255
<i>She says there's power</i>
<i>in king's blood.<i>

28
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:29,365
- Got salt pork for the feast.
- The feast is over.

29
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,393
Robb!

30
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,152
Mother.

31
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,910
The Lannisters send their regards.

32
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,939
It's too late.

33
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,922
Yah! Yah!

34
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,168
- <i>Go, move out!</i>
- <i>The King in the North!

35
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,371
<i>The King in the North!</i>

36
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,606
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

37
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,008
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

38
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,445
Here comes the
King in the North!

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,714
Here
comes the King in the North!

40
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,683
<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!<i>

41
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,587
Here comes...

42
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,701
Hmm.

43
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,683
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

44
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:23,218
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

45
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:24,820
What are you doing?

46
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:26,722
I have a list.

47
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,790
A list of people
you mean to kill?

48
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,091
For laughing at me?

49
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,227
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

50
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,195
No, death seems a bit extreme.

51
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,264
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

52
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,900
You should learn
to ignore them.

53
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,067
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

54
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,936
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

55
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,905
I'm the Halfman,

56
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,973
the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

57
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:47,542
You're a Lannister.

58
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:51,111
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

59
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,814
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

60
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,249
We're perfect for each other.

61
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,421
So how should we punish them?

62
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,023
Who? Whom?

63
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:06,125
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,794
Ah.

65
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:11,296
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

66
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,800
Anyone named Desmond
Crakehall must be a pervert.

67
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,235
I hear that you're a pervert.

68
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,571
I am the Imp.

69
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,338
I have certain standards
to maintain.

70
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,878
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

71
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,713
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

72
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:30,481
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

73
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,484
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

74
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,958
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

75
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,571
Lady Sansa!

76
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,039
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

77
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,575
And she was always
angry with me.

78
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,577
Why sheep shift?

79
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,113
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

80
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,082
My lady...

81
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,417
Well, you asked me.

82
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,818
Oh!

83
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,420
That's him!

84
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,556
My lord, my lady.

85
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,890
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

86
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:10,301
Killed a few puppies today?

87
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,270
Show him.

88
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:14,271
Come on, show him.

89
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,545
Oh, apologies, my lord.

90
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,513
Old fingers.

91
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:34,690
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

92
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:38,728
<i>Her brothers gave her a pair
of wolf pelts for her wedding.<i>

93
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,564
<i>Signed Walder Frey."<i>

94
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,301
Is that bad poetry

95
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,402
or is it supposed
to mean something?

96
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,271
Robb Stark is dead.

97
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:52,607
<i>And his bitch mother.<i>

98
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:55,477
Write back to Lord Frey.

99
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:58,179
<i>Thank him for his service</i>
<i>and command him<i>

100
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,948
to send Robb Stark's head.

101
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:04,184
I'm going to serve it to
Sansa at my wedding feast.

102
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,688
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

103
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,257
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

104
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,858
Yes, I did.

105
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,828
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

106
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,397
<i>No.<i>

107
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:19,093
She is no longer
yours to torment.

108
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,769
Everyone is mine to torment.

109
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,039
You'd do well to remember
that, you little monster.

110
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,908
Oh, I'm a monster.

111
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,445
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

112
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,713
<i>Monsters are dangerous<i>

113
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,850
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

114
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,393
I could have your tongue out

115
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,928
<i>for saying that.<i>

116
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,863
Let him make his threats.

117
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,866
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

118
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,069
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

119
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:02,172
Unacceptable, disrespectful,

120
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,308
<i>and in very bad taste.<i>

121
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,176
I am the king!

122
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,678
I will punish you.

123
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,280
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

124
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,950
is no true king.

125
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,885
I'll make sure
you understand that

126
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,454
when I've won your war for you.

127
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,156
My father won the real war.

128
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,258
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

129
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:26,061
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

130
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,675
The king is tired.

131
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,877
See him to his chambers.

132
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,145
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

133
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,882
We have so much to celebrate.

134
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,985
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

135
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:55,856
Grand Maester, perhaps
some essence of nightshade

136
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,324
to help him sleep.

137
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:01,795
I'm not tired!

138
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,231
Come.

139
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,452
Not you.

140
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:37,061
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

141
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,431
to bed without his supper.

142
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:43,033
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

143
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:46,002
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

144
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:49,039
You really think a crown
gives you power?

145
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:52,643
No.

146
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:55,479
I think armies give you power.

147
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:58,315
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

148
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,282
never lost a battle,

149
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,552
and you defeated him
all the same.

150
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:05,755
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

151
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:08,658
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

152
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,660
Or the blame, I suppose,

153
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,562
depending on your allegiance.

154
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,831
<i>Walder Frey is many things,<i>

155
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,966
but a brave man?

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,367
No.

157
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,737
He never would have
risked such an action

158
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:25,273
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

159
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,042
Which he got from me.

160
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,978
Do you disapprove?

161
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,979
<i>I'm all for cheating.</i>
<i>This is war.<i>

162
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:34,147
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

163
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:36,984
Explain to me
why it is more noble

164
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,086
to kill 10,000 men in battle

165
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,420
than a dozen at dinner.

166
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:42,456
So that's why you did it?

167
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,057
To save lives?

168
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:47,193
To end the war.
To protect the family.

169
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:50,096
<i>Do you want to write a song</i>
<i>for the dead Starks?<i>

170
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,966
Go ahead, write one.

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,435
<i>I'm in this world</i>
<i>a little while longer<i>

172
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,272
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

173
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,941
The northerners
will never forget.

174
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,342
Good.

175
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,077
Let them remember what happens

176
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:08,446
when they march on the south.

177
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,184
All the Stark men are dead.

178
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,021
Winterfell is a ruin.

179
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:19,957
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

180
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:24,996
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

181
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,468
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

182
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,972
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

183
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:39,409
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

184
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:42,779
One way or another, you will
get that girl pregnant.

185
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,314
I will not rape her.

186
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:49,753
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

187
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:52,788
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

188
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,958
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

189
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,393
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

190
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:01,664
<i>of its sons</i>
<i>and daughters first.<i>

191
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,099
A good man does
everything in his power

192
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,268
to better his family's position

193
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:10,872
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

194
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,044
Does that amuse you?

195
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,946
No, it's a very good lesson.

196
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,282
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

197
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:24,885
when you're making
all the decisions.

198
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,720
Easy for me, is it?

199
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:30,123
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

200
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,492
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

201
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:35,360
The day that you were born.

202
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,634
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

203
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:44,036
and let the waves
wash you away.

204
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:48,840
Instead, I let you live.

205
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,410
And I brought you up as my son.

206
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,216
Because you're a Lannister.

207
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,532
Sansa.

208
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,161
It's empty.

209
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,829
Let's find a place to sleep.

210
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,540
Hodor.

211
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,442
Hodor.

212
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,179
Don't, Hodor.

213
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,694
Maybe we shouldn't stay.

214
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,364
You'd rather be out there?

215
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:17,333
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

216
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,069
Horrible stories.

217
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:22,238
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

218
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:24,107
So did I.

219
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,408
Once.

220
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,645
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

221
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,881
No.
Who's he?

222
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:36,151
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

223
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,620
He was angry at the king
for something,

224
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,555
I don't remember.

225
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,357
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

226
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,826
the cook killed the king's son,

227
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,761
cooked him into a big pie

228
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:51,365
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

229
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,369
That night he served
the pie to the king.

230
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,071
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

231
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,540
he asked for a second slice.

232
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:05,745
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

233
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:08,081
<i>who could only eat</i>
<i>his own young.<i>

234
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:11,484
<i>He's been roaming</i>
<i>the Nightfort ever since,<i>

235
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,818
<i>devouring his own babies.<i>

236
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,989
But no matter what he does,

237
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,991
he's always hungry.

238
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,262
If the gods turned every killer

239
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,596
into a giant white rat--

240
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,965
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

241
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,333
<i>or for serving</i>
<i>the king's son in a pie.<i>

242
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,702
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

243
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,140
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

244
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,350
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

245
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:51,154
because I didn't get my men to
the Trident in time for battle.

246
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,523
<i>He thought he was witty.<i>

247
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,758
<i>Look at us now, Tully.<i>

248
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,795
<i>You're dead,</i>
<i>your daughter's dead,<i>

249
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,397
your grandson's dead,

250
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:03,599
your son spent his wedding
night in a dungeon

251
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,435
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

252
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,139
The Blackfish escaped.

253
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:13,842
An old man on the run

254
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:16,312
<i>with no allies.<i>

255
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,346
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

256
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,382
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

257
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,050
<i>They all laughed at me,<i>

258
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,019
all those high lords.

259
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:28,022
They all thought
they were better than me.

260
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,791
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

261
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:34,328
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

262
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,831
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

263
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:39,899
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

264
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,035
Yeah.

265
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,738
Got that to look forward to.

266
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,574
<i>And you,<i>

267
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,742
the Warden of the North.

268
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:53,112
<i>No more Starks</i>
<i>to bow and scrape to.<i>

269
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,813
Must have been torture

270
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,915
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

271
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,019
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

272
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,188
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

273
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,723
Calling himself the Young Wolf.

274
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,491
How's that for pomposity?

275
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,396
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

276
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,166
Forever young.

277
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:22,506
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

278
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,108
At some point perhaps.

279
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:27,278
But Winterfell's in ruins.

280
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:30,147
Yeah.

281
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,948
What happened up there?

282
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:35,018
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

283
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:37,620
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

284
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:40,056
And after that, nothing.

285
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,059
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

286
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:46,663
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

287
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:48,531
if they gave us Theon.

288
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh. And?

289
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,134
<i>Ramsay delivered the terms.<i>

290
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:56,305
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

291
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,508
<i>They handed him over</i>
<i>trussed and hooded.<i>

292
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:03,612
<i>But Ramsay-- well...<i>

293
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,248
<i>Ramsay has his own way</i>
<i>of doing things.<i>

294
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:09,184
Well, the girls weren't lying.

295
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:11,118
You had
a good-sized cock.

296
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,262
What?

297
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:22,697
No.

298
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,400
Pork sausage.

299
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,802
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

300
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:44,717
People talk about
phantom limbs.

301
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,153
<i>An amputee might have an itch</i>
<i>where his foot used to be.<i>

302
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,589
<i>So I've always wondered...<i>

303
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,062
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

304
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,065
<i>Next time you think</i>
<i>about naked girls,<i>

305
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,668
would you feel an itch?

306
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,610
Sorry.

307
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,546
I shouldn't make jokes.

308
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:21,117
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

309
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,224
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

310
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,293
Kill me.

311
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,261
Sorry, what?

312
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,398
Kill me.

313
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,634
A little louder.

314
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,737
Kill me!

315
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,674
You're no good to me dead.

316
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,142
We need you.

317
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:11,598
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

318
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,168
That's a name for a lord.

319
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,438
But you're not a lord,

320
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:20,640
are you?

321
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,609
You're just meat.

322
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:29,014
Stinking meat.

323
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,553
You reek.

324
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,356
Reek!

325
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,591
That's a good name for you.

326
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:43,395
What's your name?

327
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,664
Theon Greyjoy.

328
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,837
What's your name?

329
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,707
Th--

330
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:59,209
Theon Greyjoy.

331
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,450
Please.

332
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:12,489
What is your name?!

333
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:15,492
Reek.

334
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,363
My name is...

335
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,299
Reek.

336
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:53,660
Hodor.

337
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,190
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

338
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:28,927
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

339
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,863
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

340
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,664
Where are you going?

341
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:37,200
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

342
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,570
- My brother, he's in the Night's--
- Shush.

343
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,338
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

344
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,715
You're Jon's brother.

345
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,684
<i>The one who fell</i>
<i>from the window.<i>

346
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,853
No, I'm not.

347
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:01,423
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

348
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,593
And I've heard all about Hodor.

349
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,494
Hodor.

350
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:10,599
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

351
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,667
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

352
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:15,036
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

353
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,438
Take us north of the Wall.

354
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,077
What?

355
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,046
Why in the world
would you want to go--

356
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,415
I don't want to.
I have to.

357
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:29,729
How did you get
through the Wall?

358
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,153
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

359
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:35,623
Come with us.

360
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:39,160
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

361
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,027
Hodor can carry you to the top.

362
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,229
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

363
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:46,699
Come with us. There's
nothing north but death.

364
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,002
<i>If Jon is alive,<i>

365
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:50,803
<i>then Castle Black's</i>
<i>where he'll be.<i>

366
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,772
It's the safest place for you.

367
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:55,440
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

368
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:59,011
What I know is what I saw.

369
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,946
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

370
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,516
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

371
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,952
How do you know all that?

372
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:09,554
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

373
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:13,190
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

374
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,334
But you're going to stop them?

375
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,070
Please, Sam.

376
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:29,138
<i>I have to go north.<i>

377
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,576
I have to.

378
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,771
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands

379
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:06,040
and invader of the North.

380
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,076
I give you until the full moon

381
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,278
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

382
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks<i>

383
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:16,650
<i>you call a home.<i>

384
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:19,452
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>of the full moon,<i>

385
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:22,055
<i>I will hunt down every islander<i>

386
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,627
still in our lands
and flay them living

387
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:30,129
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

388
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,845
I found at Winterfell.

389
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,601
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--<i>

390
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:39,739
Theon's favorite toy.

391
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:43,109
He cried when I took it
away from him.

392
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:07,497
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

393
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:10,100
with more Theon.

394
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:12,435
Signed Ramsay Snow,

395
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,104
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

396
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:17,107
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

397
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,311
Get that out of my sight.

398
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:31,587
Theon disobeyed my orders.

399
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,458
The boy is a fool.

400
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:43,131
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

401
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:47,836
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

402
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,037
the strongholds I have taken.

403
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:51,839
Get this away from me.

404
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:54,274
He's your son.

405
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:57,144
Son?

406
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,947
He's not a man anymore.

407
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,548
He's your son.

408
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:05,019
He's my brother.

409
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:06,319
He's a Greyjoy.

410
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,588
Watch yourself.

411
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,957
I've made my decision.

412
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,031
And I've made mine.

413
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:24,203
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

414
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,808
<i>I'm going to choose the 50 best
killers on the Iron Islands.<i>

415
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:32,277
Get those ropes!

416
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,346
<i>I'm going to
sail up the Narrow Sea<i>

417
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,715
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Weeping Water.<i>

418
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,052
<i>I'm going to march</i>
<i>on the Dreadfort.<i>

419
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,821
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>my little brother<i>

420
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:46,758
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.<i>

421
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,030
What is it?

422
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,565
Dragonglass.

423
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,400
We found them at the Fist.

424
00:28:57,434 --> 00:29:01,004
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

425
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,206
Someone wanted us to find them.

426
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,077
Why?
What are they for?

427
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:13,249
Killing white walkers.

428
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,750
How do you know that?

429
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:17,419
<i>The walker
came for my baby.<i>

430
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,822
And Sam...

431
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:23,058
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

432
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:27,061
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

433
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:29,297
Take it, Hodor.

434
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,839
And the archer.

435
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,913
I got lucky

436
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,182
with one of them.

437
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,850
There are more.

438
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:53,420
<i>Many more.<i>

439
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,956
And for every one of them,

440
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,524
the dead men,

441
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,459
more than you could count.

442
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:06,165
I wish you'd come with us.

443
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,667
I wish I could.

444
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:12,371
I really do.

445
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,550
How are you keeping?

446
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,386
Great.

447
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,854
Never better.

448
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,490
It was just a bit of blood.

449
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,293
I should have known.

450
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,962
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

451
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,765
We're not really people
to you, are we?

452
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,599
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

453
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:21,302
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

454
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,204
I heard it.

455
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:27,741
A recent state of affairs.

456
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:34,747
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

457
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,950
Sure, you were.

458
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:38,684
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

459
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,753
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

460
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,188
<i>How far below?<i>

461
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:44,391
How close to the
Red Keep were you?

462
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:48,261
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

463
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:52,031
<i>flowed down the side</i>
<i>of Aegon's Hill<i>

464
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:56,101
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

465
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:58,270
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

466
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:02,908
The Street of Steel,

467
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:06,244
with your armor and your knights?
Pfft.

468
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:08,712
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

469
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:15,553
And here we are now.

470
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:19,157
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

471
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:21,625
Yeah, we've come a long way.

472
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,894
We're all the same, really.

473
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,897
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

474
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:30,300
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

475
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:33,470
why were you in such a
hurry to trust her?

476
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,240
You're me.

477
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:38,607
Never been with a woman.

478
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:41,477
<i>Never talked</i>
<i>to a woman, really.<i>

479
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:43,079
<i>And then she</i>
<i>comes at you--<i>

480
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:46,215
big words, no clothes.

481
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:48,017
What would you have done?

482
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:53,322
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

483
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:01,662
So how'd you become a lord?

484
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,365
Oh, that's a long story.

485
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:06,501
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

486
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,671
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

487
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,141
out of a difficult situation.

488
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,544
He rewarded me with a lordship.

489
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,845
And this.

490
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,949
You see?

491
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:26,152
Highborns.

492
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,225
I didn't want to be a lord.

493
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:34,026
I nearly didn't accept.

494
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,527
Why did you?

495
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:38,530
I did it for my son.

496
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:40,999
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

497
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,535
every time he stepped
through his front door.

498
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,272
I wanted him to have
a better life.

499
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,874
Does he?

500
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,810
He's dead.

501
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:00,851
How'd he die?

502
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,221
Following me.

503
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,501
When did you come
to this strange country?

504
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,704
When I was 13.

505
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,705
You were only a child.

506
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:27,242
I stopped being a child
when I was 9.

507
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:30,079
My mother made sure of that.

508
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:33,488
You've been a good influence

509
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,809
on our mutual friend, you know.

510
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:37,911
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

511
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:39,613
visit 3 brothels a night,

512
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,182
gamble away his father's money.

513
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,149
Now it's just the drinking.

514
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:47,553
And now I'm his wife's servant.

515
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,522
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

516
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,023
and empty her chamber pot.

517
00:34:51,057 --> 00:34:52,525
She is a sweet young thing.

518
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,026
None of this is her fault.

519
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,995
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

520
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,964
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

521
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:02,066
No, I expect not.

522
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:07,872
She's young and she's
beautiful and highborn.

523
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,674
We break bread with them,

524
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:12,276
but that doesn't
make us family.

525
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,778
We've learned their language,

526
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:16,347
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

527
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,084
If you let yourself believe

528
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,320
that a foreign girl
with no name

529
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,689
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister--

530
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,492
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

531
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,060
As do I.

532
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,028
Here only the family
name matters.

533
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,365
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

534
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,770
Diamonds.

535
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:43,639
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

536
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,141
but you know how
to protect yourself.

537
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,810
Get on one of those ships.

538
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,546
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

539
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:54,783
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

540
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:56,785
a very large house.

541
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:58,653
Hire servants.

542
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,088
Start a new life,

543
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:02,557
a good life, far from here.

544
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:05,659
The mysterious foreign beauty.

545
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,661
You'll have suitors lining up.

546
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:09,997
Why do you want me to leave?

547
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:12,700
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

548
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,802
who could make this country
a better place.

549
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,537
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

550
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,005
he has the right last name.

551
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,106
And you--

552
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,309
you are a complication.

553
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:26,646
I know you love him.

554
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,717
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

555
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,219
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

556
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:35,888
I'm asking you to leave

557
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:38,924
because your presence
in the capital

558
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,326
endangers him.

559
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,897
This will never
be your home, my lady.

560
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:49,370
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

561
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,369
while there's still time.

562
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,173
Lord Varys.

563
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:03,147
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

564
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,566
Keep up.

565
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,269
I don't think I can, my lord.

566
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:20,806
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

567
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:25,244
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

568
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,714
Leave.

569
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:42,360
So, enjoying married life?

570
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:49,867
An unhappy wife is a wine
merchant's best friend.

571
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:52,236
She doesn't deserve this.

572
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,804
Deserve?

573
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,739
Be careful with that.

574
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,943
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

575
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,412
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

576
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,681
weeping for each and every
person in the world.

577
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,319
There's nothing worse than a
late-blooming philosopher.

578
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,988
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

579
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:16,125
with the same
philosophical spirit?

580
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,659
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

581
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:20,629
I seem to remember
saying something similar

582
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,631
about my own marriage.

583
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:24,934
You're not me.

584
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,069
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

585
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:29,837
Give her a child.

586
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:31,772
So you can tell Father
it was you

587
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:34,075
who finally talked me into it?

588
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:37,211
So she can have some
happiness in her life.

589
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,879
You have children.

590
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:42,083
How happy would
you say you are?

591
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:46,686
Not very.

592
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,880
But if it weren't
for my children,

593
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,816
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

594
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:59,220
They're the reason I'm alive.

595
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,322
Even Joffrey?

596
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,224
Even Joffrey.

597
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,298
He was all I had once.

598
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:13,000
Before Myrcella was born.

599
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,105
I used to spend hours

600
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,574
looking at him.

601
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,710
His wisps of hair.

602
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,514
His tiny little hands and feet.

603
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,017
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

604
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:37,289
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

605
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:40,091
"We should have known. Even
then we should have known."

606
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,227
It's nonsense.

607
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:46,565
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

608
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,236
And no one can take that
away from me,

609
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,038
not even Joffrey--

610
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:56,674
how it feels to have someone.

611
00:39:57,676 --> 00:40:00,177
Someone of your own.

612
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:12,522
How long does it go on?

613
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,594
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

614
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:21,897
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

615
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:23,999
we create two more.

616
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:28,904
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

617
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:36,278
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

618
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:41,583
<i>Sounded like a cow in heat.<i>

619
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:43,918
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

620
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,254
Black Walder shut
her up right quick.

621
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,491
<i>None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.<i>

622
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,058
I'll tell you what, though.

623
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:54,395
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

624
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,930
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

625
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:00,066
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

626
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:01,835
It was me.

627
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,805
And Malcolm and Talbott.

628
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,574
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

629
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:09,174
Took the skin right with it.

630
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:12,177
<i>What we ended up having to do</i>
<i>was hook the needle<i>

631
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:13,780
<i>right under the collarbone.<i>

632
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:16,616
Give it a nice
firm mooring and--

633
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,186
What do you want?

634
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:24,489
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

635
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,892
But I'm hungry.

636
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:30,328
Does fuck off mean something
different where you're from?

637
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,497
I've got money.

638
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,570
What kind of coin is that?

639
00:41:38,604 --> 00:41:40,438
It's worth a lot.

640
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,374
Sorry.

641
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,410
Little shit.

642
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:52,849
<i>Fool!<i>

643
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,298
Where did you get the knife?

644
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,033
From you.

645
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:18,039
<i>Is that the first
man you've killed?<i>

646
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:20,175
The first man.

647
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,811
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

648
00:42:23,846 --> 00:42:25,980
tell me first.

649
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:40,026
Valar morghulis.

650
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:11,856
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

651
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,862
You always knew who I was,

652
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:19,731
what I am.

653
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,936
I have to go home now.

654
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:29,439
I know you won't hurt me.

655
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,043
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

656
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,149
I do know some things.

657
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,985
I know I love you.

658
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,989
<i>I know you love me.<i>

659
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,461
But I have to go home now.

660
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,568
I know how this must look.

661
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:41,340
- What I meant was--
- I swear to you, my lord--

662
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:43,876
I'm not a lord, my dear.

663
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:46,612
Not for many, many years.

664
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:49,982
<i>Every man who joins</i>
<i>the Night's Watch<i>

665
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:54,086
renounces all former titles.

666
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,990
Among other things.

667
00:45:00,893 --> 00:45:02,793
What is your name?

668
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,495
Gilly.

669
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:07,832
Ah, for the gillyflower.

670
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:09,299
Lovely.

671
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,736
Yes, my--

672
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:15,439
Maester.

673
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:17,556
Master.

674
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,176
Maester.

675
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,178
And the child?

676
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:25,815
She hasn't chosen a name yet.

677
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,151
His name is Sam.

678
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:33,757
Tarly...

679
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,259
do you remember
the oath you swore

680
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:39,862
when you joined this order?

681
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:43,065
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

682
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,301
She's one of Craster's wives.

683
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:54,676
I remember every word
of the oath.

684
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:58,312
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

685
00:45:58,346 --> 00:46:02,349
<i>I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.<i>

686
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,987
The realms of men.

687
00:46:08,856 --> 00:46:11,658
That means her as well as us.

688
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:15,062
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls,

689
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:17,798
700 feet high to keep out men.

690
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,135
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

691
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,236
I've seen it.

692
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:26,772
It's coming for all of us.

693
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,544
Gilly, you and your son

694
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,647
will be our guests
for the time being.

695
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:40,585
We certainly cannot
send you back

696
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,587
beyond the Wall.

697
00:46:42,621 --> 00:46:45,123
Thank you...

698
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:47,425
Maester.

699
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:49,627
I can cook and clean
and I can--

700
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:51,329
Good.

701
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:55,899
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

702
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:03,607
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

703
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:05,743
Miles better.

704
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:11,214
We had 44 ravens at last count.

705
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,817
Make sure they're all fed.

706
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:18,121
Every one of them
flies tonight.

707
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:29,564
"To His Grace

708
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:32,300
King Stannis Baratheon.

Invaded-- inv--

for Rylene Florent

712
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:48,149
on the first nigit--"

713
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:50,084
Night.

714
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,452
"First night
of the full moon."

715
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:53,888
Why is there a G in night?

716
00:47:53,922 --> 00:47:55,990
I don't know.
There just is.

717
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:59,259
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

718
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:03,196
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

719
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,231
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

720
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:08,768
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

721
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,104
I'd like to see that someday.

722
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,440
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

723
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:18,110
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

724
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:21,479
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

725
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:24,549
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

726
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,052
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

727
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,354
I have to keep him informed.

728
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,924
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

729
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:38,930
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

730
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:41,732
- Noblemen.
- <i>"Noblemen of Westeros,<i>

731
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:46,270
the Nig--
the Night's Watch...

732
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,407
implores..."

733
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,076
What is it?

734
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:59,382
Why are they ringing the bells?

735
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,251
<i>Are we being attacked?<i>

736
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,752
Stay here.

737
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:05,921
Bar the door.

738
00:49:24,306 --> 00:49:26,674
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.

739
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:30,111
Betrayed by his bannerman.

740
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:33,948
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

741
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:35,582
I take no credit.

742
00:49:35,616 --> 00:49:38,651
<i>I have faith and my faith
has been rewarded.<i>

743
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:46,126
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

744
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,062
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

745
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:50,797
but my eyes were open.

746
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,665
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

747
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,902
or because at war
men die all the time,

748
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:59,105
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

749
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:00,773
with blood magic is wrong.

750
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,008
It is evil.

751
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,110
And you are not an evil man.

752
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:06,945
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

753
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,147
Aegon Targaryen.

754
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:11,816
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

755
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,919
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

756
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:17,855
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

757
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,558
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

758
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:22,627
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

759
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:26,196
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

760
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:30,167
<i>I will not forget that.<i>

761
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,836
I will not forgive that.

762
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:37,174
I will punish them
with any arms

763
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,475
at my disposal.

764
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:41,344
You do not need
to burn the boy.

765
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:44,680
<i>If what you say is true,<i>

766
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:47,716
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark--

767
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,586
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

768
00:50:53,324 --> 00:50:56,691
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

769
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:15,709
His name is Gendry.

770
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,378
He's a good lad.

771
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,581
A poor lad from Flea Bottom

772
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:23,284
who happens to be your nephew.

773
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:32,092
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

774
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:35,628
Everything.

775
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,764
The boy must die.

776
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,073
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

777
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,942
Is this some kind of trick?

778
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,644
Yes, but not on you.

779
00:51:57,582 --> 00:52:00,518
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

780
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,786
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

781
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:04,489
If you finish it off,

782
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,857
no matter how thirsty you get,

783
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,826
don't drink seawater.

784
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,861
I know not to drink seawater.

785
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:15,565
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

786
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,335
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

787
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:19,702
Where should I go?

788
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,138
You must keep the coast
on your left side

789
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,705
until you reach King's Landing.

790
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,606
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

791
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,342
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

792
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,277
- Do they know your face?
- No.

793
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,112
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

794
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,787
The other way.

795
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:45,160
You ever been in a boat before?

796
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:46,727
No.

797
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:48,096
You know how to swim?

798
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,330
No.

799
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:50,798
Don't fall out.

800
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:53,334
Go on.

801
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:56,670
Why are you doing this?

802
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:59,173
<i>Because it's right.<i>

803
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:01,075
And because I'm a slow learner.

804
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:07,281
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

805
00:53:12,018 --> 00:53:13,786
<i>Horse approaching!<i>

806
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,989
Halt! Halt!

807
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:36,575
Jon! Jon!

808
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,310
<i>Jon, it's us.<i>

809
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:40,645
I don't think he can see us.

810
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:47,651
Pyp?

811
00:53:47,685 --> 00:53:49,886
Sam?

812
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:53,290
Hush, now.
You're home.

813
00:53:54,926 --> 00:53:57,995
Carry him inside.
Gently.

814
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,654
Out of the way.

815
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:27,322
Step aside, country boy.

816
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:29,224
People working here.

817
00:55:14,301 --> 00:55:16,435
Cersei.

818
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:37,120
You don't deny it?

819
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:39,155
No.

820
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:42,292
I let him go.

821
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:45,395
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

822
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,231
You feel good about that?

823
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:48,632
Aye, I do.

824
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:51,167
<i>You saved one innocent.<i>

825
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:54,937
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

826
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,543
There has got
to be another way.

827
00:56:00,577 --> 00:56:02,010
What other way?!

828
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:03,846
Tell us about this other way.

829
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,481
I don't know, Your Grace.

830
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:08,116
I can't see the future
in the fire.

831
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:14,689
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

832
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:18,526
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

833
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:20,995
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

834
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:22,930
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

835
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:25,232
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

836
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,735
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

837
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:30,404
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

838
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,574
Why am I gonna need you?

839
00:56:37,879 --> 00:56:39,312
My king.

840
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:45,618
<i>It's from Maester
Aemon of the Night's Watch.<i>

841
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:47,420
<i>Their Lord Commander is dead.<i>

842
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:50,055
<i>Took a ranging party north</i>
<i>and never made it back.<i>

843
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,358
One lad did, though.

844
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:55,027
What he saw
beyond the Wall--

845
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,496
it's coming for all of us.

846
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:13,477
When did you learn to read?

847
00:57:13,512 --> 00:57:14,978
Matthos taught me
before he died

848
00:57:15,013 --> 00:57:17,080
so I could be
of better service to you.

849
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:28,090
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

850
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:32,629
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.<i>

851
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:36,032
Death marches on the Wall.

852
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,702
Only you can stop him.

853
00:57:38,736 --> 00:57:40,804
You can't stop him alone.

854
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:43,439
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

855
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:46,107
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

856
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:48,210
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

857
00:57:48,244 --> 00:57:50,612
I've made my decision.

858
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,217
He's right.
You need him.

859
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:57,886
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

860
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:09,330
You see, Ser Davos?

861
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:12,734
You've been saved by that
fire god you like to mock.

862
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,505
You're in his army now.

863
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:43,863
They will come, Your Grace.

864
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:45,765
When they're ready.

865
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:47,632
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

866
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:50,167
You didn't conquer them.

867
00:58:50,202 --> 00:58:52,336
You liberated them.

868
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:55,001
People learn to love
their chains.

869
00:59:57,566 --> 00:59:59,567
No.

870
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,804
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

871
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:42,607
Mhysa! Mhysa!

872
01:00:42,641 --> 01:00:44,942
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

873
01:00:45,844 --> 01:00:47,912
What does it mean?

874
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:50,848
It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi.

875
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:53,250
It means "mother."

876
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:01,324
It's all right.

877
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,059
These people won't hurt me.

878
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:08,231
Mhysa! Mhysa!

879
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,179
Mhysa.

880
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:14,292
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
