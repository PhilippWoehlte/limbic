2
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,884
I'm so sorry, my queen.

3
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,769
He was a good man.

4
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,189
"Barristan the Bold"
they called him.

5
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:48,261
He crossed a continent
to serve me.

6
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,797
He was a loyal friend.

7
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,968
And he died in an alley,

8
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,054
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

9
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,309
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

10
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,646
<i>secure it, and use it as a
base from which to operate.</i>

11
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,816
Then we clean the city out,

12
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:13,720
<i>neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,</i>

13
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:16,022
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

14
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,495
I prefer
your earlier suggestion.

15
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:26,332
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

16
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:31,587
But I'm the leader of my family.

17
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,146
No, Your Grace!

18
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:38,227
I had nothing to do with this.

19
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:40,179
Your Grace!

20
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,832
Don't want to overfeed them.

21
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:18,504
Tomorrow perhaps.

22
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,960
"And though Daenerys maintains
her grip on Slaver's Bay,

23
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:01,430
forces rise against her
from within and without.

24
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,549
She refuses to leave
until the freedom

25
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,385
of the former slaves
is secure."

26
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,472
She sounds like quite a woman.

27
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:11,390
And she's alone,

28
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,025
under siege,

29
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,445
no family to guide her
or protect her.

30
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,566
Her last relation
thousands of miles away,

31
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,153
useless, dying.

32
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:28,407
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

33
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:33,496
A Targaryen alone in the world

34
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:36,082
is a terrible thing.

35
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,803
Maester Aemon.

36
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,089
Lord Commander.

37
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,092
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

38
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,109
How are you feeling?

39
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,778
Oh, like
a hundred-year-old man

40
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,247
slowly freezing to death.

41
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:15,421
I need your advice.

42
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:18,007
There's something I want
to do, something I...

43
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,458
have to do.

44
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,911
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

45
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:23,547
Bitterly.

46
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:26,301
Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

47
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:30,643
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

48
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,728
Do it.

49
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,591
But you don't know what it is.

50
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,415
That doesn't matter.

51
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,818
You do.

52
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:44,657
You will find little joy
in your command.

53
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,243
But with luck,

54
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,839
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

55
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:56,452
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

56
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,005
Winter is almost upon us.

57
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,791
Kill the boy

58
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,911
and let the man be born.

59
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,356
Where are the rest
of the free folk now?

60
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,191
Where have they gone?

61
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,664
Who leads them?

62
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,167
They followed Mance.

63
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,591
They won't follow anyone else.

64
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:35,452
What about you?

65
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:39,389
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

66
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,678
What if I unchained you?

67
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,045
Why would you do that?

68
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:50,684
Because you are not my enemy.

69
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,402
And I'm not yours.

70
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:55,322
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

71
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,108
For 8,000 years the Night's
Watch have sworn an oath

72
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,159
to be the shield that
guards the realms of men.

73
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,332
And for 8,000 years we've
fallen short of that oath.

74
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:08,452
You belong to the realms of men.

75
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:10,454
All of you.

76
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:13,290
And now everything
is going to change?

77
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,292
- It is.
- Why now?

78
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:19,346
Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

79
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,516
What would you have me do,

80
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,968
Lord Commander?

81
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,722
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

82
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:32,559
Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.

83
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,146
I'll open the gates for
them and let them through.

84
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:39,283
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

85
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:42,903
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

86
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:45,822
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

87
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:48,325
I want them to fight with
me when the time comes.

88
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:51,128
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

89
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:54,081
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

90
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,165
and make me eat them.

91
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:58,135
And how many of your
people can't fight?

92
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:01,255
The women, the children,
the old, the sick...

93
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,140
What happens to them?

94
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,225
You're condemning them to death.

95
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,046
Worse than death because you're
too proud to make peace.

96
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:14,585
Or maybe you're not proud.

97
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,105
Maybe you're just a coward.

98
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,115
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

99
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,274
Your people need a leader.

100
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:57,561
And they need to get south of
the Wall before it's too late.

101
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,696
We don't have much time
and they have less.

102
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,649
The walkers are coming and
they'll hit your people first.

103
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:07,237
I'm not asking you to make
peace to save your skin.

104
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:11,074
Make peace to save your people.

105
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,752
Most of them are at Hardhome.

106
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,086
You know where that is?

107
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,972
Up on Storrold's Point.

108
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:27,174
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

109
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,105
You can get there in a week.

110
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,761
We'll need ships.

111
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,765
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

112
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:39,736
All right, then.

113
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,774
You're coming with me.

114
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:47,444
<i>You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.</i>

115
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,780
They need to hear it from you.

116
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,082
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

117
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,334
wot be torched
in the middle of the sea.

118
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:59,539
You come with me or I don't go.

119
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,267
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

120
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,804
Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.

121
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,057
Let them die. We got our
own to worry about.

122
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,060
Less enemies for us.

123
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,812
Fewer.

124
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,581
- What?
- Nothing.

125
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:28,452
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

126
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,821
Land that no one uses now.

127
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,873
A dozen abandoned villages.

128
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:35,042
And why do you think the farmers
abandoned those villages?

129
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:38,355
<i>Because the wildlings
raided them for years.</i>

130
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,925
Cut them down!

131
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,168
Just like they did this boy's people.

132
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,105
Aye!

133
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:48,775
<i>We've been fighting
them for thousands of years.</i>

134
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,860
They've slaughtered villages.

135
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,892
<i>They've slaughtered
our brothers.</i>

136
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,165
And we've slaughtered theirs.

137
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:00,475
I will follow you
anywhere, you know that.

138
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:04,540
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

139
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,608
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

140
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,367
<i>They killed 50 of our brothers.</i>

141
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,798
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

142
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,967
I can't forgive it.

143
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,210
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

144
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,474
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

145
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,634
<i>We can learn to live
with the wildlings</i>

146
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,610
<i>or we can add them
to the army of the dead.</i>

147
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:28,031
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

148
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:57,759
Thank you.

149
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,427
<i>Olly.</i>

150
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:04,099
<i>If you have something
you want to say to me,</i>

151
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,817
<i>say it.</i>

152
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,609
It's all right.

153
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,113
You don't mean it, do you?

154
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,367
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

155
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,402
You're just doing it
to trick them.

156
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:25,954
It's not a trick.

157
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,539
They burned my village.

158
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,624
They put an arrow
through my father's head

159
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:30,826
right in front of me.

160
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:34,496
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

161
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:45,190
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

162
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,611
I know this is hard for you.

163
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,982
But winter is coming.

164
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:57,519
We know what's coming with it.

165
00:15:57,553 --> 00:15:59,454
We can't face it alone.

166
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,879
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

167
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,717
No.

168
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:48,570
She's far away
from the Lannisters.

169
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:51,039
<i>This is her home.</i>

170
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:56,310
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

171
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,947
Better off with the Boltons

172
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:02,650
who murdered
her mother and brother?

173
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:14,044
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

174
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,894
Thank you.

175
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,094
You've lived here a long time?

176
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,067
Aye.

177
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:39,820
Did you know Lord Eddard?

178
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,024
I knew him

179
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,577
and his father before him.

180
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,698
The Starks are gone now.

181
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,533
Not all of them.

182
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:55,369
<i>I know who's inside that castle.</i>

183
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,288
Everyone knows.

184
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,772
The Boltons.

185
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:01,167
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

186
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,795
I need to get a message to her.

187
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:06,680
To Sansa Stark.

188
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,010
Who are you?

189
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,220
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

190
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,022
Swore to who?

191
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,224
Her mother.

192
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,143
Her mother's dead.

193
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:21,946
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

194
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,568
I served Lady Catelyn.

195
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,204
I serve her still.

196
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,674
Who do you serve?

197
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:42,166
<i>Come back here.</i>

198
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,054
Myranda.

199
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,156
I saw you staring at her.

200
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,891
I'm going to marry her.

201
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,011
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

202
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,350
You said you'd marry me.

203
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:02,269
And I meant it.

204
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,405
When I was a bastard named Snow.

205
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,690
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>

206
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:10,878
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

207
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm furthering a dynasty.

208
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:17,618
Do you think she's pretty?

209
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:20,354
Of course I do.

210
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,789
I'm not blind.

211
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:37,187
You think she's pretty, too.

212
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,476
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

213
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:46,313
But don't worry, I'll have
plenty of time for you.

214
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,899
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

215
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,907
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

216
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,160
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

217
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,335
You're mine.

218
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:11,388
You're not going anywhere.

219
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,343
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

220
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,977
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

221
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,600
You're not going to bore
me, are you, Myranda?

222
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,620
Never.

223
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,116
Beg pardon, my lady.

224
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,485
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

225
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:16,403
Oh, I don't need...

226
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:19,957
You still have
friends in the North.

227
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,620
If you're ever in trouble,

228
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,629
light a candle in the highest
window of the broken tower.

229
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:29,249
- But who...
- You're not alone.

230
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,256
I like your dress.

231
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,426
Who made it for you?

232
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,095
I made it myself.

233
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,130
Really?

234
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,851
Who... who are you?

235
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,936
I'm Myranda, the kennel
master's daughter.

236
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:28,642
May I?

237
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,783
Oh, wonderful.

238
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,819
The stitching.

239
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:42,256
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

240
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:47,377
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

241
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:48,712
Thank you.

242
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:52,666
It's good that she taught you.

243
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,167
It was a gift.

244
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:59,172
Now every time you wear
something you made,

245
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,008
you can remember her.

246
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,543
I'd rather have a mother.

247
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:06,313
I know.
It's not the same.

248
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:09,592
Still, it's good to remember.

249
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,236
Remember the way things were.

250
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:16,490
I almost forgot.

251
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,359
There's something else

252
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,778
<i>to help you remember.</i>

253
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:33,707
Down there at the end.

254
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:36,426
What is it?

255
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,378
That would spoil the surprise.

256
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:42,799
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

257
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,018
You won't believe it
when you see it.

258
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:48,915
Theon?

259
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:01,211
You shouldn't be here.

260
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:25,285
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

261
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,873
Pour me some wine.

262
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:56,183
Do you have
something to tell me?

263
00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:58,830
No, my lord.

264
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,854
Reek.

265
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,693
She saw me.

266
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,195
Who?

267
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:11,081
Sansa.
Lady Sansa.

268
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,783
She came to the kennels.

269
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,229
She saw you?

270
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,481
Yes.
I'm sorry, master.

271
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,400
Forgive me.
I didn't think...

272
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:21,402
Come here.

273
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:32,463
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

274
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:34,331
Get on your knees.

275
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:48,762
Give me your hand.

276
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,703
I forgive you.

277
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:27,017
I trust you find your
chamber suitable, my lady.

278
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,219
Yes, thank you, my lord.

279
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,055
Allow me.

280
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,477
Mother.

281
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,445
Thank you, Ramsay.

282
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:53,210
My lady, we are all a
family, we northerners.

283
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:56,664
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

284
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,683
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

285
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:03,087
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

286
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,254
to the Last Hearth.

287
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,223
To your wedding.

288
00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:08,175
To your wedding.

289
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:18,068
It must be difficult for you
being in a strange place.

290
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:20,938
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

291
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,221
It's the people who are strange.

292
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,330
You're right.

293
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:30,914
Very strange.

294
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,753
More wine, please.

295
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,979
<i>I heard you two had reunited.</i>

296
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:48,048
A fitting place for it.

297
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:53,303
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

298
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,305
was in this very room.

299
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:00,644
<i>Are you still angry with him</i>

300
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,563
<i>after he...</i>

301
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:08,402
what he did?

302
00:29:08,453 --> 00:29:10,788
Don't worry.

303
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:12,990
The North remembers.

304
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:16,493
I punished him for it.

305
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,912
He's not ironborn anymore.

306
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:22,166
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

307
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:24,001
He's a new man.

308
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:28,472
A new person, anyway.

309
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,174
Aren't you, Reek?

310
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:31,842
Yes, master.

311
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:34,061
That's his
new name... Reek.

312
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:36,180
Why are you doing this?

313
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,318
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

314
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:42,953
Don't you, Reek?

315
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:54,865
An apology.

316
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:03,841
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

317
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:08,178
Apologize for murding
her two brothers.

318
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,636
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:19,189
Look at her, Reek.

320
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,059
<i>An apology doesn't mean anything</i>

321
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:24,661
<i>if you're not looking
the person in the eye.</i>

322
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,737
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Sorry about what?</i>

323
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,740
For killing your brothers.

324
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:50,170
There, over and done with.

325
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:53,724
<i>Doesn't everyone
feel better? I do.</i>

326
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:56,677
That was getting very tense.

327
00:30:57,562 --> 00:30:59,263
Whew.

328
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,235
You know what, my lady?

329
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,105
What with him having
murdered your brothers

330
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:10,607
and the rest
of your family gone...

331
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,830
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

332
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:18,866
that you have left.

333
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,169
Reek.

334
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:24,087
You will give away the bride.

335
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:30,427
Someone has to.
What better person?

336
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:31,929
Good? Good?

337
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:35,349
Yes, yes, very good.

338
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:37,384
Wonderful.

339
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:41,805
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

340
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:43,607
since we're all together.

341
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,141
We're going to have a baby.

342
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,539
I'm very happy for you.

343
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:00,541
From the way she's carrying,

344
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:03,460
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

345
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:20,561
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

346
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,813
Sure of what?

347
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,748
That she's pregnant.

348
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:26,817
I mean...

349
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:28,518
how can you tell?

350
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,880
Maester Wolkan has assured
us beyond all doubt.

351
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:43,450
So how did you manage it?

352
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,335
Manage what?

353
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,704
Getting her pregnant.

354
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,806
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

355
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:52,926
Of course, but how did you...

356
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:53,966
find it?

357
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:56,847
You disgraced yourself at dinner

358
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:59,216
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

359
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,852
And if it's a boy?

360
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,722
You're worried about
your position.

361
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,858
My position is quite clear.

362
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,694
I'm your son

363
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,230
until a better
alternative comes along.

364
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,658
You've never asked me
about your mother.

365
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:31,581
Why would I?

366
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,418
She had me, she died.

367
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:38,273
And here we are.

368
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,630
She was a peasant girl.

369
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,466
Pretty in a common sort of way.

370
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:45,709
She was the miller's wife.

371
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:49,186
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.

372
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,168
So I had him hanged

373
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:54,727
and I took her beneath the
tree where he was swaying.

374
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:56,237
She fought me the whole time.

375
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:59,031
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

376
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,228
<i>A year later
she came to my gates</i>

377
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,210
<i>with a squalling baby
in her arms.</i>

378
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,905
<i>A baby she claimed was mine.</i>

379
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,549
I nearly had her whipped

380
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:10,076
and the child
thrown in the river.

381
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,966
But then I looked at you

382
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,936
<i>and I saw then what I see now.</i>

383
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,171
You are my son.

384
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,005
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

385
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:40,248
But he won't stay for long.

386
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,917
He wants the Iron Throne,

387
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,410
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

388
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,447
He means to take the North.

389
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,334
But the North is ours.

390
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:56,503
It's yours and mine.

391
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,123
Will you help me defeat him?

392
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:03,460
Yes.

393
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,637
Is this every book there is?

394
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:16,557
Every book there is?

395
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,777
- In the world.
- Well, no.

396
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:24,815
There are thousands and
thousands of books out there.

397
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:27,067
This library is rather
small, actually.

398
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,785
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

399
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,655
My father's not
the most literate man.

400
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:37,661
They say the Citadel has the
largest library in the world.

401
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:39,129
Where's that?

402
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:42,816
The Citadel?

403
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,585
In Oldtown.

404
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:52,693
I'm sorry I don't know things.

405
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:55,898
Gilly, look at me.

406
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:59,852
<i>You know how to do a hundred
things I can never do.</i>

407
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,155
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

408
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:04,607
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

409
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:07,360
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

410
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:10,747
- Well...
- Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

411
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:13,916
<i>It's where they train
the maesters.</i>

412
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,485
Like Maester Aemon?

413
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,287
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

414
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:25,094
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

415
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,500
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

416
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:34,187
I wouldn't have met you.

417
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,978
Ah, Your Grace.

418
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:51,654
You're Samwell Tarly?

419
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:54,757
I am, Your Grace.

420
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,076
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

421
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:02,665
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

422
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,886
<i>Only battle Robert ever lost.</i>

423
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,506
I told him he shouldn't go so far
west so soon, but he never listened.

424
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,728
<i>Fine soldier, your father.</i>

425
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:17,847
You don't look like a soldier.

426
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,851
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

427
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,686
I did, Your Grace.

428
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:24,987
<i>How?</i>

429
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:27,156
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

430
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:28,191
Dragonglass?

431
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:30,026
What the maesters call obsidian.

432
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:32,361
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

433
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:33,976
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

434
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:36,115
I don't know.

435
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,007
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

436
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:40,286
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

437
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:43,241
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

438
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:47,510
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

439
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,073
I've seen it, Your Grace.

440
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:54,050
Seen what?

441
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,953
The army of the dead.

442
00:37:56,987 --> 00:38:00,656
- And when they come...
- We have to know how to fight them.

443
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:06,979
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

444
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,132
It's time.

445
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,417
Uh, Your Grace.

446
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:30,970
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

447
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:33,851
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

448
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:35,442
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

449
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:37,139
We can't wait that long.

450
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:40,760
We have the advantage... more men,
more horses, all fed and rested.

451
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,763
<i>But every day we wait, the
odds shift in Bolton's favor.</i>

452
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:45,898
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

453
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,733
We have to act now.
Give the order.

454
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,268
We march at sunrise.

455
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,020
I'll choose a dozen men to stay

456
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:53,489
and guard the queen
and the princess.

457
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:55,403
No need.
They're coming with us.

458
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,111
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

459
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:01,914
- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

460
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:05,618
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

461
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,588
No, they march with us.

462
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:13,759
As you wish, Your Grace.

463
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:41,988
<i>Do you think Father will
let me go down into the crypt?</i>

464
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,630
Beg your pardon?

465
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,408
At Winterfell.

466
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,493
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

467
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,328
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and...

468
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,714
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

469
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,716
And then we have
to take the castle.

470
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,167
Is there going to be a battle?

471
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,670
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near...

472
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,923
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

473
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:02,391
You'll scare the child.

474
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:04,844
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

475
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,182
- I'm not scared.
- Well, I am.

476
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:13,185
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

477
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,321
I promise.

478
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,544
I hope you know what you're
doing with these wildlings.

479
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,963
I need those ships.

480
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:45,184
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

481
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,055
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

482
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:51,891
And thank you.

483
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:22,555
<i>Mount up!</i>

484
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,590
<i>Colors!</i>

485
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:16,142
No.

486
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:18,110
You're still too weak.

487
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:22,648
_

488
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:24,714
_

489
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:30,623
Ser Barristan?

490
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,737
_

491
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,594
_

492
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,310
_

493
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,037
_

494
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,492
_

495
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,993
_

496
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,651
<i>Are you ashamed?</i>

497
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,688
<i>You were ambushed, outnumbered.</i>

498
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,657
<i>There was no way
you could have known.</i>

499
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:06,742
This is not why.

500
00:43:09,196 --> 00:43:11,413
Wounded in war,

501
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:14,783
there is no shame for this.

502
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:16,952
I am ashamed

503
00:43:17,003 --> 00:43:19,538
because when the knife go in

504
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:22,925
and I fall to the ground,

505
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,877
I am afraid.

506
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,514
All men fear death.

507
00:43:28,548 --> 00:43:31,333
No, not death.

508
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:36,555
I fear

509
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:41,520
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

510
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,649
Now you have given the
Masters what they deserve.

511
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,234
If I give everyone
what they deserve,

512
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:24,436
I'll have no one left to rule.

513
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:26,989
Ser Barristan counseled mercy

514
00:44:27,023 --> 00:44:29,704
when I took this city right
up to the morning he died.

515
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,528
<i>Daario Naharis thinks I should
kill the former Masters</i>

516
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,740
<i>and let the rest of the
city fend for itself.</i>

517
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,950
What do you think?

518
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:41,537
Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

519
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:43,956
to have an opinion
on these matters.

520
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:46,458
You are as fit as anyone I know.

521
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:50,129
You know why I'm here.

522
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,215
And you know who will suffer the
most if this all falls apart.

523
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:56,435
<i>So what do you think?</i>

524
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:02,141
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

525
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:05,477
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

526
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:10,816
I have seen you lean on their
experience when your own was lacking

527
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:13,919
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

528
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:18,624
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

529
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:23,996
because there was
a better choice.

530
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,382
One that only you could see.

531
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:46,352
My... my queen,
please do not do this.

532
00:45:46,354 --> 00:45:48,354
<i>What about "valar morghulis"?</i>

533
00:45:48,356 --> 00:45:50,939
I did not want to die a coward.

534
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,330
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

535
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,668
It takes courage to admit fear.

536
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:06,372
And to admit a mistake.

537
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:10,459
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

538
00:46:13,346 --> 00:46:15,964
I was wrong and you were right.

539
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:20,052
About tradition.

540
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:24,306
About bringing the people
of this city together.

541
00:46:27,694 --> 00:46:29,895
I will reopen the fighting pits.

542
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:32,448
To free men only.

543
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:36,702
Slavery will never return to
Meereen, not while I live.

544
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:38,821
Yes, my queen.

545
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:46,161
And in order to forge a lasting
bond with the Meereenese people,

546
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:48,997
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

547
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:54,253
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

548
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:24,199
Don't worry.

549
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,703
I'll be fine. Nothing
broken, I don't think.

550
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,673
Where are we now?

551
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,792
Not the Rhoyne.

552
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,518
Long, sullen silences

553
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:45,554
and an occasional
punch in the face.

554
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:49,475
The Mormont way.

555
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,697
Let's start over.

556
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,318
I apologize for before.

557
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,321
<i>My mouth sometimes
runs away from me.</i>

558
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:05,290
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

559
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,240
We're going to be spending a lot of
time together on the way to Meereen.

560
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:14,633
We are.

561
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:19,805
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

562
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,340
would be some wine.

563
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:23,675
No wine.

564
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:29,848
I am a person who drinks.

565
00:48:31,518 --> 00:48:33,852
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

566
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:35,938
<i>Otherwise, they're not...</i>

567
00:48:43,363 --> 00:48:44,863
I know where we are.

568
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,416
You're taking us
through Valyria.

569
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,834
I am.

570
00:48:48,868 --> 00:48:51,036
Have you sailed
this route before?

571
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:52,621
No.

572
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:54,623
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

573
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:56,875
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

574
00:48:56,877 --> 00:48:59,461
I think you'll be plenty.

575
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:02,681
<i>You know what they say.</i>

576
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:05,934
The Doom still rules Valyria.

577
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,887
What about the demons
and the flames?

578
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:11,773
<i>Aren't you afraid of the Doom?</i>

579
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:13,609
<i>No.</i>

580
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:16,061
But pirates are.

581
00:49:16,946 --> 00:49:18,564
Oh.

582
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:25,037
The Smoking Sea.

583
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:27,039
How many centuries
before we learn

584
00:49:27,073 --> 00:49:29,457
how to build cities
like this again?

585
00:49:30,692 --> 00:49:33,494
Thousands of years the Valyrians were

586
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:36,337
the best in the world
at almost everything.

587
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:39,333
And then...

588
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:42,119
And then they weren't.

589
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,787
And then they weren't.

590
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:51,211
"They held each other close and
turned their backs upon the end.

591
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:54,265
<i>The hills that split asunder</i>

592
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:57,101
and the black
that ate the skies;

593
00:49:57,135 --> 00:49:58,832
The flames that shot
so high and hot

594
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:01,055
that even dragons burned;

595
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:02,882
Would never be the final sights

596
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:05,643
that fell upon their eyes.

597
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:07,795
A fly upon a wall,

598
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:12,351
the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned..."

599
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:15,304
"The city of a thousand years,

600
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,222
and all that men had learned;

601
00:50:17,273 --> 00:50:20,726
The Doom consumed it all alike,

602
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:23,478
and neither
of them turned."

603
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:28,567
I would clap.

604
00:50:33,623 --> 00:50:35,991
I suppose this is it, then.

605
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,294
This is what remains.

606
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,202
What was that?

607
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:29,127
Stone Men!

608
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:31,079
Don't let them touch you!

609
00:51:47,363 --> 00:51:49,064
Get behind!

610
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:54,036
Mormont, cut me free!

611
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,238
Mormont!

612
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,921
Mormont!

613
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:15,057
Mormont!

614
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:52,660
Tyrion?

615
00:52:55,497 --> 00:52:57,999
Tyrion.

616
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,701
Tyrion.

617
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,121
Tyrion.

618
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,424
You're all right.

619
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:18,303
You're heavier than you look.

620
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:23,141
Did any of them touch you?

621
00:53:25,895 --> 00:53:27,812
You?

622
00:53:32,785 --> 00:53:35,703
I've seen greyscale before,

623
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:37,205
but nothing like that.

624
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:40,158
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

625
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:45,681
It'd be kinder to put daggers in
their hearts and be done with it.

626
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:52,837
Thank you for saving me.

627
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:58,343
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

628
00:53:58,345 --> 00:54:00,626
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

629
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:06,534
So what now?

630
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:08,725
We walk up the coast.

631
00:54:08,776 --> 00:54:10,611
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

632
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:12,646
Maybe another boat.

633
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,932
Without luck?

634
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:17,651
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

635
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:22,706
I'll get some wood for a fire.

636
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,492
Try to get some rest, huh?

637
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:28,278
That's the best idea
you've had all day.

638
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:24,585
