1
00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:03,814
- <i>The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.</i>
- How?!

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:06,283
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:08,986
<i>Returning him may buy life</i>
<i>for my children.</i>

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,056
Ser Barristan Selmy, it is
time to put aside your sword.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,260
You're too old
to protect anyone.

6
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:18,931
Even now I could cut through the
5 of you like carving a cake.

7
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:20,900
Here, boy.

8
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,637
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,273
Where are my dragons?!

10
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,609
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

11
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:29,843
where I have put them.

12
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:32,847
Walder Frey is a
dangerous man to cross.

13
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:35,149
<i>I love her.</i>

14
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:36,751
The Iron Throne is mine.

15
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:37,986
No one wants you
for their king.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,855
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

17
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,925
<i>The night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

18
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,128
If Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

19
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,098
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

20
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,766
<i>Mance is gonna
march on the Wall.</i>

21
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,469
<i>One brother inside his army</i>

22
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,137
will be worth 1,000
fighting against it.

23
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:55,072
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

24
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:57,142
<i>if you do what needs</i>
<i>to be done.</i>

25
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:00,111
<i>Come along, Jon Snow.</i>

26
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,414
Time to meet
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

27
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,850
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

28
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,318
Dracarys.

29
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,557
When I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

30
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,058
I pray I serve you well.

31
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:15,694
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

32
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:28,342
The battle is over.
We have won.

33
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,612
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

34
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,683
If it weren't for your squire's
bravery you'd be a dead man.

35
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:38,153
Ser Loras Tyrell, I will
gladly wed your sweet sister.

36
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,291
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

37
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,993
<i>This war has just begun.</i>

38
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,761
<i>You will be king.</i>

39
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,598
It's Jon and the Halfhand.

40
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,667
Two blasts is wildlings.

41
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:54,338
Run!

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,959
<i>Fall back!</i>

43
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,543
Brother?

44
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:27,461
Did you send the ravens?

45
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:33,868
Tarly, look at me.

46
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,539
Did you send the ravens?

47
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:44,078
<i>That was your job.</i>

48
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:46,881
Your only job.

49
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,059
We need to get
back to the Wall.

50
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,728
<i>It's a long march.</i>

51
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,497
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

52
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:07,301
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

53
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,171
or before winter's done,

54
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:12,373
everyone you've ever known

55
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:14,208
will be dead.

56
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,751
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

57
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:15,391
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

58
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:21,030
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

59
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,199
And when they're angry,

60
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,336
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

61
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,371
like a hammer on a nail.

62
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,683
<i>- Crow!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

63
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:43,820
<i>- Look over there!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

64
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:46,688
<i>Crow! Look over here!
Look!</i>

65
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:49,858
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

66
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,594
<i>Crow!</i>

67
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,998
You're wearing
the wrong color.

68
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,534
Mance was a ranger.

69
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,673
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

70
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,608
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

71
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:06,643
- Crow!
- Crow!

72
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:07,978
Sure, you will.

73
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:11,213
Oh!

74
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:14,117
And I'll be free to kill you.

75
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,753
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

76
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:20,957
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

77
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,326
What happened to their fathers?

78
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:27,597
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

79
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,068
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

80
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,138
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

81
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:38,041
And if he don't...

82
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,265
I smell a crow.

83
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,500
We killed his friends.

84
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,336
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

85
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,473
What do we want
with a baby crow?

86
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:12,443
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

87
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:15,679
<i>He wants to be one of us.</i>

88
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:24,388
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

89
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,824
Friends twice your size.

90
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,396
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

91
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,900
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

92
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,769
Plenty of little men

93
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,739
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

94
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:44,541
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

95
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,243
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

96
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,315
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

97
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,524
Your Grace.

98
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,262
Your Grace?

99
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,964
Did you hear that?

100
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,067
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

101
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,503
Stand, boy.

102
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,642
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

103
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,517
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

104
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,685
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

105
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,389
You can leave us.

106
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,699
The girl likes you.

107
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,901
You like her back, Snow?

108
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,304
That why you want to join us?

109
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,106
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

110
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,342
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

111
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,578
where we make you
swear off girls.

112
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:55,281
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

113
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,751
Can't believe this pup

114
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,086
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

115
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,321
He was our enemy

116
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,224
and I'm glad he's dead.

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,702
He was my brother once.

118
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,405
Back when he had a whole hand.

119
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,942
What were you doing with him?

120
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,279
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

121
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,147
Why?

122
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,949
He wants me to lead one day.

123
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,453
But here you are, a traitor

124
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,955
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

125
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,559
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

126
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,170
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

127
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,111
I want to be free.

128
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,281
No, I don't think so.

129
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,484
I think what you want
most of all

130
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,719
is to be a hero.

131
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:11,657
I'll ask you
one last time--

132
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,726
why do you want to join us?

133
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,767
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

134
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,671
I saw...

135
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,272
You saw what?

136
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,643
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

137
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,412
and leave it in the woods.

138
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,714
I saw what took it.

139
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:45,356
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

140
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,696
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

141
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,799
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

142
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,834
he already knew.

143
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,439
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

144
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,809
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

145
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,813
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

146
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,085
Did I come to the right place?

147
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,625
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

148
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,949
What if you took off
that bit there?

149
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,688
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

150
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,624
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

151
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,796
I want you to take it off.

152
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,970
Mouth.

153
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,744
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

154
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,615
I didn't hear that.

155
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,650
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

156
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,620
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

157
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:28,290
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

158
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:31,293
I will murder you, boy.

159
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,795
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

160
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:53,813
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

161
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,418
<i>The queen.</i>

162
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,467
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

163
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,670
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

164
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,539
No, I don't think so.

165
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,275
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

166
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,977
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

167
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,485
They stay outside.

168
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,754
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

169
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,172
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

170
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,777
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

171
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:57,247
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

172
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:59,650
I should hope so.

173
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,986
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

174
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,088
Thanks to Father.

175
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,591
Thanks to Father.

176
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,195
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

177
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,764
No? Curious.

178
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,601
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

179
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,837
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

180
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,840
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

181
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:26,177
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

182
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,978
You're meeting Father today?

183
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,081
How do you know that?

184
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,951
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

185
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,487
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

186
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,125
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

187
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,793
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

188
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,329
Do I need to want something?

189
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,999
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

190
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,734
as any father loves his child,

191
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,437
his baby boy.

192
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,539
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

193
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,207
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

194
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,343
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

195
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,913
but Father never came.

196
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:11,486
You're going to make me cry.

197
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,888
Why do you care
what I want from him?

198
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:17,392
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

199
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,660
Slandered?
When?

200
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,929
<i>You told him I had my guards</i>

201
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:23,830
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

202
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:25,699
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

203
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:26,967
A girl of 9, I believe.

204
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,802
<i>I was 9, too.</i>

205
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,870
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

206
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,305
If I remember correctly,

207
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:34,574
she never stole
a necklace again.

208
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:39,179
It's not slander if it's true.

209
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:41,915
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

210
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,683
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

211
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,952
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

212
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:48,054
Because you're a liar.

213
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:51,158
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

214
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,661
Any lies in particular?

215
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:57,832
You're a clever man,

216
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,135
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

217
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:03,205
Still makes me
more clever than you.

218
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,012
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

219
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:13,515
Ser Taryn Mant and...

220
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,284
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

221
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:16,685
Ser Meryn Trant.

222
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,255
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

223
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,891
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

224
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,359
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater

225
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,294
was anointed
by the king himself.

226
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,030
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

227
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,666
nothing more.

228
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,635
That's exactly who I am.

229
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,436
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

230
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:36,740
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

231
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,543
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

232
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,413
You put your hand on that door,

233
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,049
you lose the hand.

234
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,567
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

235
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,736
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

236
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,871
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

237
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:09,205
You're here to protect me.

238
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,441
I've been doing that
for a while now.

239
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,243
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

240
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,744
I grow poor protecting you.

241
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,679
Poor?
Poor?

242
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,781
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

243
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,883
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

244
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,653
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

245
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,755
And now my pockets are empty.

246
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,124
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

247
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,160
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

248
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,528
you'll need to pay more.

249
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:34,030
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

250
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:36,833
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

251
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,634
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

252
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,102
- How much?
- Double.

253
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,304
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

254
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:43,772
Knights are worth double.

255
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,175
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

256
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,277
Which means you can afford it.

257
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,849
Here. Here!

258
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,661
Help me!

259
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,620
Who are you?

260
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:10,361
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

261
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,400
I was a captain and a knight.

262
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,304
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

263
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,647
The one true king
of Westeros--

264
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,351
Stannis Baratheon.

265
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,528
I thought you were dead.

266
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,197
Everyone thought you were dead.

267
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,769
And your son?

268
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,944
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

269
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,014
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

270
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,759
I'm so sorry, my friend.

271
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,329
I, too, have lost a son.

272
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,731
There is nothing worse
in this world.

273
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,635
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

274
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,205
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

275
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:33,809
Stannis lives?

276
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:36,045
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

277
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,846
Will you take me there?

278
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,282
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

279
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:41,783
This war is not over.

280
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:43,151
Not for you, maybe.

281
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,921
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

282
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:47,956
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

283
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,459
I am sworn to no man.

284
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:54,296
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

285
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,831
I delivered the ships.

286
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,034
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

287
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,470
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

288
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,973
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

289
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,642
They say he sees no one--

290
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,911
not his generals,
not even his wife.

291
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,948
Only the Red Woman

292
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,349
whispering in his ear,

293
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,218
telling him what
she sees in the flames

294
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,887
and burning men alive.

295
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,355
What?

296
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,892
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

297
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,828
All those who spoke
against her she called

298
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,464
servants of darkness.

299
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,968
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

300
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,275
I'm a pirate.

301
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,610
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

302
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,312
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

303
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,615
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

304
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,916
Take me back there, please.

305
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,851
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

306
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:51,520
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

307
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,155
You could try.

308
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,558
If you fail,
they will burn you.

309
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:58,461
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

310
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:00,630
And you've only
just come back to life.

311
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,899
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

312
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,668
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

313
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:08,170
And you drank with me
on 4 of my wedding days,

314
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,106
but I don't ask you for favors.

315
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,741
I have to stop her.

316
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:14,911
Please, do this for me.

317
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,117
When you are dead,

318
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,586
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

319
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,723
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

320
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,939
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

321
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,742
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

322
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,277
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

323
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,178
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

324
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,381
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

325
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,117
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

326
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,954
I don't think
we're going to get one.

327
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:48,275
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

328
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:51,346
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

329
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,182
For them and for your sons.

330
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:56,384
Will it?

331
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:58,752
They rot in the ground

332
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,988
<i>while their killer runs free.</i>

333
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:03,957
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

334
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:06,827
My best hunters are after him.

335
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:29,483
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

336
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:32,052
My father's bannerman.

337
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:55,276
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

338
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:08,990
<i>She's your mother.</i>

339
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,659
She freed Jaime Lannister.

340
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,062
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

341
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,864
and she robbed them
of their justice.

342
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,167
<i>Water.</i>

343
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,004
Water.

344
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,273
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

345
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,015
What's your name, friend?

346
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,916
Qyburn.

347
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:35,318
You're lucky to be alive.

348
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:41,057
Lucky?

349
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,022
The badge looks good on you.

350
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,493
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

351
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:18,865
Are you enjoying
your new position?

352
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:22,035
Am I enjoying it?

353
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,471
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

354
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:26,539
Yes.

355
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:28,541
I heard how happy you were.

356
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,045
You brought a whore
into my bed.

357
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,681
It wasn't your bed at the time.

358
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:41,053
I sent you here
to advise the king.

359
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:45,123
I gave you real power
and authority.

360
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,492
You chose to spend your days

361
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:49,694
as you always have,

362
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:52,163
bedding harlots

363
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:54,565
and drinking with thieves.

364
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,095
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

365
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,931
What do you want, Tyrion?

366
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:03,981
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

367
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,917
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

368
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:10,554
My beloved father who

369
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:13,685
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

370
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:15,158
after he fell
on the battlefield.

371
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:18,762
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

372
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:21,798
I organized
the defense of this city

373
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:25,001
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

374
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,769
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

375
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,072
while your grandson, the king,

376
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:32,741
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

377
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:36,378
I bled in the mud
for our family.

378
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:38,881
And as my reward,

379
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:42,251
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

380
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,286
But what do I want?

381
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,756
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

382
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,026
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

383
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:53,496
You are a Lannister.

384
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,565
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

385
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,302
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

386
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,303
Hmm?

387
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:05,140
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

388
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,542
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

389
00:31:07,577 --> 00:31:12,347
So tell me what you want.

390
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:19,055
I want what is mine by right.

391
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:24,094
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

392
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:28,433
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

393
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,502
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

394
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:34,305
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

395
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,408
I am your son and lawful heir.

396
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,013
You want Casterly Rock?

397
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,015
It is mine by right.

398
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:50,689
We'll find you accommodations

399
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:52,625
more suited to your name

400
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,027
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

401
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:57,930
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

402
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:02,634
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

403
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:03,335
<i>fit for your talents</i>

404
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,905
so that you can
serve your family

405
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,040
and protect our legacy.

406
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:10,309
<i>And if you serve faithfully,</i>

407
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:12,278
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

408
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:16,648
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

409
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:18,450
<i>before mocking the family name</i>

410
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:20,420
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

411
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,823
- Why?
- Why?

412
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,992
You ask that?

413
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,428
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

414
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:34,599
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

415
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:38,637
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

416
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:43,239
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

417
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:45,877
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

418
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,948
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

419
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:54,384
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

420
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,322
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

421
00:32:57,356 --> 00:33:00,057
But neither gods nor men

422
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,993
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

423
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:05,129
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

424
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:08,032
Go, now.

425
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:14,939
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

426
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,143
Go.

427
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,253
Oh, one more thing.

428
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,792
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

429
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:46,538
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

430
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:49,474
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

431
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:52,978
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

432
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:59,350
But it's not coming back.

433
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:01,986
The captain's tired
of risking his life

434
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,189
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

435
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:07,292
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

436
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,863
He's going to stay in Dorne.

437
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:14,233
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

438
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:18,037
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

439
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,040
Don't ruin the game.

440
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,810
I told you,
I don't want to play.

441
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,946
What about that one there?

442
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,448
That one?

443
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,484
It's going to Volantis.

444
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:30,952
Why?

445
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,687
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

446
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,256
it looked like that one.

447
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,092
That's not how the game works.

448
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:40,696
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

449
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,330
You've got to invent a story

450
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:45,800
about where the ship
is going and why.

451
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,704
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

452
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,772
Because the truth

453
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:53,342
is always either
terrible or boring.

454
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:56,145
Lovely day for it.

455
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,081
Watching the ships.

456
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:01,084
Lord Baelish.

457
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,154
Might I speak with Lady Sansa

458
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,823
alone for a moment?

459
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:20,170
I saw your mother not long ago.

460
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,873
She's very eager to see you.

461
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:28,944
And your sister.

462
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:31,581
Arya's alive?

463
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,752
You said you'd take me home.

464
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:40,155
You said King's Landing
was your home.

465
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:43,724
You are the property
of the crown.

466
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,125
Stealing you would be treason.

467
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,394
If you were to tell
just one person--

468
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,430
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

469
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,398
Because I'm a terrible liar.

470
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:53,067
You said so yourself.

471
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:56,270
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

472
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:01,041
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

473
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,277
that will take me far away
from the capital.

474
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,012
When I set sail,

475
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:08,581
I might be able
to take you with me.

476
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:11,617
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

477
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:16,322
You're her handmaiden?

478
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:21,194
Yes.
And you're his...?

479
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,698
I help manage his affairs.

480
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:28,135
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

481
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,703
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

482
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:32,739
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

483
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,175
from sunrise till sunset.

484
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:40,180
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

485
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:44,518
Yes.

486
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,788
Given where we started.

487
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:50,057
And where is that?

488
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:53,593
It's not easy for girls like us

489
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,796
to dig our way out.

490
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:03,169
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

491
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:06,038
I always do.

492
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,774
Watch out for her with him.

493
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:03,165
They're growing fast.

494
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:07,902
Not fast enough.

495
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:11,340
I can't wait that long.

496
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:16,212
I need an army.

497
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:20,015
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

498
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:24,086
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

499
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,923
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

500
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,259
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

501
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:31,127
Do those people
have any better ideas

502
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:34,430
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

503
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:37,967
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

504
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,305
You're right.

505
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:48,510
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

506
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:50,311
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

507
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:52,714
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

508
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:55,116
They followed me
across the poison water.

509
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,451
If they'll do it, others will.

510
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:58,018
And with a true
khalasar--

511
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:02,156
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

512
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:05,959
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

513
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,195
And not before.

514
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,023
Your Grace.

515
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:50,605
I heard you were dead.

516
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,507
Not yet.

517
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,512
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

518
00:39:58,581 --> 00:40:00,582
We are alone.

519
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:13,763
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

520
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:16,666
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

521
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,669
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

522
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:22,005
And there is still
a war to fight.

523
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,740
I am fighting.

524
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:27,410
By burning prisoners alive?

525
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:31,481
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

526
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,951
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

527
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:36,086
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

528
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,855
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

529
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:41,591
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

530
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,931
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

531
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,735
<i>Did I set your ships ablaze?</i>

532
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,377
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

533
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,049
I could have saved those men.

534
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,717
You would have taken the city,

535
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,626
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

536
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:09,322
and you would stand beside him.

537
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,891
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

538
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:15,595
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

539
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,806
Do you hear them screaming?

540
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,143
All those burning men
in the water

541
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,845
crying for their mothers,

542
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,748
for their gods for help?

543
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:38,517
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

544
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:47,792
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

545
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:50,194
What I told your son is true.

546
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:52,596
Death by fire

547
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:54,332
is the purest death.

548
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:58,469
This woman is evil!

549
00:41:58,537 --> 00:42:00,171
She's the mother of demons.

550
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:03,040
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

551
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:04,575
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

552
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,877
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

553
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:08,779
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

554
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:10,815
<i>Your Grace!</i>

555
00:42:38,276 --> 00:42:40,878
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

556
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,949
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

557
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:52,424
Why have we stopped?

558
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,992
It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

559
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:01,166
<i>What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?</i>

560
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,103
My lady. We should
have guards, my lady.

561
00:43:05,138 --> 00:43:07,506
Why?

562
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:12,411
Pardon me.

563
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,856
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

564
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,691
I have others.

565
00:43:30,498 --> 00:43:32,899
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

566
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,171
No.

567
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,939
He was a soldier.

568
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:41,874
He went to fight on the walls

569
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:44,477
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

570
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,579
He never came back.

571
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:48,414
And your mother?

572
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:50,849
She died when she had me.

573
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,688
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

574
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:59,391
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

575
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:07,400
Whenever you look
at this knight,

576
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:10,269
I want you to remember
your father.

577
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:14,739
He wasn't a knight.

578
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:16,708
He was just a soldier.

579
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:19,110
And what do knights
swear to do?

580
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:22,479
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

581
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:26,249
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

582
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:32,155
Was your father a soldier, too?

583
00:44:33,223 --> 00:44:36,092
You should be proud, too.

584
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,263
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

585
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:43,032
your fathers saved the city.

586
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,368
They saved us all.

587
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:48,772
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

588
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:53,209
All of you.

589
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:02,017
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

590
00:45:02,052 --> 00:45:04,119
clothe them, or house them.

591
00:45:05,922 --> 00:45:08,022
Directly to me.

592
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,939
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

593
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:26,574
Please, sit.
Sit.

594
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:29,077
I do apologize, my lady.

595
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:31,447
Small council meetings.

596
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,582
At what point
does it become treason

597
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:35,484
to waste the king's time?

598
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:41,925
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

599
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,961
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

600
00:45:43,995 --> 00:45:46,397
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

601
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:49,801
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

602
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:53,537
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

603
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:56,040
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

604
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:59,277
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

605
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,279
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

606
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:04,416
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

607
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,318
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

608
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:08,987
I've never seen
anything like it.

609
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:10,922
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

610
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:13,558
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

611
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:17,395
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

612
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,197
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

613
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:23,601
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

614
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:25,169
the High Septon told me about.

615
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:27,872
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

616
00:46:27,906 --> 00:46:32,210
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

617
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:34,513
and approach them
with an open heart.

618
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,615
<i>An open heart is what
you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

619
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:38,216
<i>if you're not careful, my dear.</i>

620
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,086
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

621
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:45,056
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

622
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,059
The king barely escaped
with his life.

623
00:46:48,093 --> 00:46:51,563
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

624
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,166
Facts become less and less
important to her

625
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,201
<i>as she grows older.</i>

626
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,171
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

627
00:47:00,406 --> 00:47:02,140
You're right, of course.

628
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:05,410
But you are your father's son.

629
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:07,612
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

630
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,990
Hunger turns men into beasts.

631
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:21,861
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

632
00:47:21,896 --> 00:47:25,732
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

633
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:29,269
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

634
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,972
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

635
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:34,041
in time of need.

636
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:35,776
Well, as Ser Loras said,

637
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,946
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

638
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,666
charitable work before.

639
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,084
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

640
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:47,488
I'm sure she does.

641
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:19,123
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

642
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:21,293
with no food or water.

643
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,802
They will stand
until they drop.

644
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:34,039
Such is their obedience.

645
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,144
They may suit my needs.

646
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,146
Tell me of their training.

647
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:02,260
They begin their
training at 5.

648
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:04,731
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

649
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:06,934
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

650
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:09,369
the shield,
and the 3 spears.

651
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:13,007
Only one boy in 4 survives
this rigorous training.

652
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,079
<i>Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.</i>

653
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:20,881
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

654
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:23,950
Even the bravest men
fear death.

655
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:48,075
<i>My master says
the Unsullied are not men.</i>

656
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:50,477
Death means nothing to them.

657
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:01,954
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

658
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:18,937
Tell the good master
there is no need.

659
00:50:26,379 --> 00:50:29,347
<i>My master points out
that men don't need nipples.</i>

660
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:47,333
To win his shield,

661
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:51,103
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

662
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:56,108
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

663
00:50:58,445 --> 00:51:00,879
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

664
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:03,015
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

665
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:07,153
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

666
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:11,490
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

667
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:28,006
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

668
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,609
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

669
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,717
How many do you have to sell?

670
00:51:44,058 --> 00:51:45,725
8,000.

671
00:51:50,665 --> 00:51:53,301
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

672
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:56,170
Many other buyers
are interested.

673
00:52:06,314 --> 00:52:09,483
8,000 dead babies.

674
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:12,086
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

675
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,455
Once I own them,
these men--

676
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:17,024
They're not men.
Not anymore.

677
00:52:17,058 --> 00:52:20,427
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

678
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:22,529
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

679
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:25,999
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

680
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:41,213
You'll be fair to them.

681
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:44,016
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

682
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:50,790
You won't order them
to murder babies.

683
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:53,660
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

684
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:56,529
A great injustice
has been done to them.

685
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:00,233
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

686
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,957
The warlocks.

687
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:05,298
I owe you my life, ser.

688
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:06,967
The honor is mine,

689
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:09,202
my queen.

690
00:54:12,573 --> 00:54:14,841
You know this man?

691
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,676
I know him

692
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,181
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

693
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:22,783
and as the Lord Commander

694
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:25,585
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

695
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:29,056
King Robert is dead.

696
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,959
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

697
00:54:31,993 --> 00:54:34,528
to ask your forgiveness.

698
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,598
I was sworn to protect
your family.

699
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:41,268
I failed them.

700
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,943
I am Barristan Selmy,

701
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:51,279
Kingsguard to your father.

702
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:53,714
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

703
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:56,818
and I will not fail you again.
