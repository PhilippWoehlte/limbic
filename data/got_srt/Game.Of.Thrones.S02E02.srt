1
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:41,698
<i>Gotta be ready</i>
<i>before nightfall.</i>

2
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,101
Okay, keep moving.

3
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,208
<i>Put a watch</i>
<i>on the Ridge</i>

4
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,410
<i>and the tree lines.</i>

5
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,148
<i>Boy.</i>

6
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,585
Lovely boy.

7
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,387
What do you want?

8
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,955
A man has a thirst.

9
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,125
A man does not drink
for a day and a night.

10
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,226
A boy could
make a friend.

11
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,628
I have friends.

12
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,864
Give us beer
before I skin you.

13
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,967
A man does not choose
his companions.

14
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,902
These two, they have
no courtesy.

15
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,271
A man must ask
forgiveness.

16
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,142
You're called Arry?

17
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,515
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar,

18
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:32,050
once of the free city of--

19
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,719
Beer, you little shit.

20
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,288
Get us beer!

21
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,090
You should have
asked nicely.

22
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,258
Aah!

23
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:46,500
Come closer
and I'll shove that stick

24
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,203
up your bunghole
and fuck you bloody.

25
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,772
A boy has more courage
than sense.

26
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,374
Come here!

27
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,109
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

28
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:57,211
- Come here!
- They don't scare me.

29
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,313
Hmm?
Then you're stupid.

30
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:01,215
They scare me.

31
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,321
What are Gold Cloaks doing so
far from King's Landing?

32
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,994
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

33
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,930
You in command here?

34
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,900
You're a long way
from home.

35
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,036
I asked you a question.

36
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,838
Aye, you did.

37
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,942
You asked
without manners

38
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:31,545
and I chose not to answer.

39
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,615
I have a royal warrant

40
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,286
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

41
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,792
Well, the thing is...

42
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,094
These gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch.

43
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,898
<i>Now, that puts them beyond the</i>
<i>reach of Kings and Queens.</i>

44
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,767
Does it?

45
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,169
<i>It's a funny thing--</i>

46
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,338
people worry so much
about their throats

47
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:59,742
that they forget
about what's down low.

48
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,980
Now I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

49
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:08,384
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to

50
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,389
or I could nick
this artery in your leg.

51
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,992
And once it's nicked,
there's no one around here

52
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:18,095
who knows
how to unnick it.

53
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,931
We'll just keep that.

54
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,970
Good steel is always
needed on the Wall.

55
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,704
Seems you have
a choice--

56
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:31,942
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

57
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,811
or you can go back to your city
and tell your Masters

58
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:37,847
you didn't find
what you were looking for.

59
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:45,689
We're looking
for a boy named Gendry.

60
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,293
<i>He carries</i>
<i>a bull's head helmet.</i>

61
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:53,331
<i>Anyone turning him over</i>
<i>will earn the King's reward.</i>

62
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,334
We'll be back
with more men

63
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:59,203
and I'll be taking your head
home along with that bastard boy.

64
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,306
My Lord.

65
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,307
You make me wait
a long time,

66
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,577
but your friend
keeps me company.

67
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,680
We were just speaking
of your bravery

68
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,116
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

69
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:50,553
It was quite a battle.

70
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:54,056
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

71
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:57,026
The northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

72
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,663
And I tell him
the story of how we meet.

73
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,732
To find so lovely
a creature

74
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,568
working in your
father's kitchens--

75
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:06,837
it almost beggars belief.

76
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,908
Strange things do happen.

77
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,711
You should taste
her fish pie.

78
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:15,080
I don't think Lord Varys
likes fish pie.

79
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,083
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

80
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,319
<i>Men like Lord Varys</i>
<i>and I can't let</i>

81
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,521
our disadvantages
get the best of us.

82
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:25,423
We'll make a fisherman
of him yet.

83
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,324
I am glad
your new friend

84
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:30,460
was able to accompany you
to the capital.

85
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:34,564
Friends are such
an important part of life.

86
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,066
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

87
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,635
<i>But rest easy, My Lord.</i>

88
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,639
I am very good
at keeping secrets

89
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,874
for my good friends.

90
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:47,377
Your discretion
is legendary...

91
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,811
where your friends
are concerned.

92
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:51,314
How unspeakable of me
to go on and on

93
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,583
when all you want
to do is rest.

94
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,752
I will leave you.

95
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,922
Welcome to King's Landing,
my dear.

96
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:02,393
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

97
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,762
We have a council meeting,
My Lord.

98
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,601
I don't like threats.

99
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:12,904
- Who threatened you?
- I'm not Ned Stark.

100
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:15,072
I understand the way
this game is played.

101
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,707
Ned Stark
was a man of honor.

102
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,175
And I am not.

103
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,712
Threaten me again and I'll have
you thrown into the sea.

104
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,151
You might be disappointed
in the results.

105
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:30,154
Storms come and go,

106
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,356
the big fish eat
the little fish,

107
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,425
and I keep on paddling.

108
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:37,861
Come, My Lord.

109
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,263
We shouldn't keep
the queen waiting.

110
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,303
<i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

111
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,171
<i>we are not part</i>
<i>of your realm,</i>

112
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,075
but a free and independent
kingdom of the North."

113
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:00,280
He has more spirit than
his father, I'll give him that.

114
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:03,617
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

115
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:06,153
We can give him his father's bones
back at least

116
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:07,888
as a gesture
of good faith.

117
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,957
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

118
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,060
I will, Your Grace.

119
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,696
Did you see my brother

120
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,131
when you were
the Starks' guest?

121
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,066
<i>I did.</i>

122
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,802
<i>They have not broken</i>
<i>his spirit, Your Grace.</i>

123
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,539
If you speak with him,

124
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:27,475
tell him he's not
been forgotten.

125
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,844
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

126
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:36,484
You have a deft hand
with diplomacy.

127
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,755
- If that's everything...
- A-- a raven flew in this morning

128
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,658
from Castle Black.

129
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,293
Trouble with
the wildlings.

130
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,795
That's why they're
called "wildlings."

131
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,464
Somewhat less wild
these days.

132
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,300
Seems they've stopped
killing each other

133
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:55,437
and started following
this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

134
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,273
Another king?
How many is that now, 5?

135
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,075
I've lost count.

136
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:03,912
The Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man the Wall.

137
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,614
Perhaps he's forgotten
we're fighting a war.

138
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,616
We have no men to spare.

139
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,352
"The cold winds
are rising

140
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:11,955
and the dead rise
with them."

141
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:15,592
The northerners are
a superstitious people.

142
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:17,694
According to the Commander,
one of these dead men

143
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,764
attacked him
in his chambers.

144
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,799
Mormont doesn't lie.

145
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,469
<i>How do you kill</i>
<i>a dead man?</i>

146
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,438
Apparently you burn him.

147
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:30,408
One trip to the Wall
and you come back

148
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:33,778
believing in grumpkins
and snarks.

149
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:37,348
I don't know
what I believe,

150
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,449
but here's
a fact for you--

151
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:41,084
<i>the Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

152
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,786
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

153
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:46,222
I have every confidence
that the brave men

154
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,959
of the Night's Watch
will protect us all.

155
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,162
<i>And I said,</i>

156
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,863
"if the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

157
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:56,766
they wouldn't make us
fart when we died."

158
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,502
We fart when we die?

159
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,471
My blessed mother--

160
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,573
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

161
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:08,176
She farted so hard,
the whole bed shook.

162
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,288
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

163
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,791
Wouldn't 2 or 3
be enough for him?

164
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,728
We were having
a serious discussion.

165
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,965
Would you look at that?

166
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,204
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

167
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:37,107
I prefer watching them
come towards me.

168
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:38,742
I'm sure
that's nice, too.

169
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:41,911
Yeah, well, there was
a milkmaid named Violet

170
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,514
on the next farm over
from where I grew up.

171
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:47,516
<i>We were wrestling together</i>
<i>from the time we were 6 years old.</i>

172
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:52,521
And then we got older
and the wrestling, uh...

173
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,757
Changed.

174
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,625
You were with her?

175
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,261
How many times?

176
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,797
Well, as many times
as I could.

177
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,603
I wish I grew up
on a farm.

178
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:09,972
We need more potatoes.

179
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,374
Get another sack
from the sledge.

180
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,880
Get the turnips, too.

181
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,894
No. Ghost, no.

182
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,363
<i>No!</i>

183
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,965
Ghost, away.
Shoo, shoo!

184
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,871
You all right?

185
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,708
- Did he frighten you?
- You-- you shouldn't touch me.

186
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,312
Oh. Oh, right.

187
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,981
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,784
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't hurt.

189
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:02,826
You're very brave.

190
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,171
What are you doing?

191
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,005
This is Gilly.

192
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,441
She's one of Craster's...
daughters.

193
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,324
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?

194
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,017
Sam said
you could help.

195
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,786
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed--

196
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:25,911
She's pregnant.

197
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:36,227
We have to take her
with us when we leave.

198
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,062
What?

199
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,897
- What would that--
- I know it sounds a bit mad.

200
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,765
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

201
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,034
- The Lord Commander ordered us to--
- We are sworn to protect.

202
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:46,636
- Sam, we can't take--
- please, ser, please.

203
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,571
I can still run
if I have to.

204
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:51,007
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

205
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,609
If it's a boy...

206
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,577
If it's a boy, what?

207
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,951
You want us to risk
our lives for you

208
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,087
and you won't even
tell us why?

209
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,729
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

210
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,564
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

211
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,566
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

212
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,935
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

213
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,704
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

214
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,739
I can't steal her.

215
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,041
She's a person,
not a goat.

216
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,417
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

217
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:37,254
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

218
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:40,190
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

219
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:42,092
Who's going to
deliver a baby, you?

220
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:45,296
I could try.

221
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:48,265
What?
I've read about it.

222
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,901
A bit.

223
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:54,706
I'm sorry, Sam.

224
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,641
We can't help her.

225
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,269
Khaleesi.

226
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,251
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

227
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,025
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

228
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,394
<i>Khal Jhaqo.</i>

229
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:54,497
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a Khalasar.

230
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,766
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

231
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:31,860
Is it as you remember,
My Lord?

232
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:34,095
It looks smaller.

233
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,963
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

234
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,898
I remember
my father's cabin

235
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,733
felt like a palace
when I was little.

236
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:43,270
Now look at it.

237
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:45,572
They'll be waiting
for me on the docks.

238
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,374
Who will?

239
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,242
<i>Anyone who matters.</i>

240
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,444
This is a big day for them.

241
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,981
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

242
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,083
It's a hard place,
the Iron Islands.

243
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,652
<i>Always has been.</i>

244
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,921
It's cold and it's wet.

245
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:02,690
Oh, I love
the cold and wet.

246
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:05,292
They say hard places
breed hard men.

247
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,530
And hard men
rule the world.

248
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:14,034
Then you'll be king
before long.

249
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:19,840
Try smiling with
your lips closed.

250
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:22,008
Better.

251
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:27,347
My father doesn't trust
you Iron islanders.

252
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:29,349
I don't blame him.

253
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:32,386
<i>He says that you're all</i>
<i>reavers and rapers</i>

254
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,254
and that no matter
how many women you have,

255
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,289
you'll never be sat-- uh!

256
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:39,592
Quit talking about your father.

257
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:42,429
But he's right
about us.

258
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:46,165
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

259
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,568
That's not enough for us.

260
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:51,070
That's why
we take salt wives--

261
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,672
the women we capture.

262
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:54,207
Capture me.

263
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:56,342
Take me with you
when you go ashore.

264
00:20:56,377 --> 00:21:00,514
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

265
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,682
Not after you leave.

266
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:05,051
Father will punish me.

267
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,686
He'll call me a whore.

268
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,257
I haven't paid you.

269
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,839
Oh, yeah.

270
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,985
<i>I paid good money...</i>

271
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:48,830
I'm not going to stand for this.

272
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,565
I barely touched her.

273
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,801
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

274
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,702
and this is
what I get-- crying.

275
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:57,072
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

276
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,784
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

277
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:11,186
Aremca will take
good care of you.

278
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:45,721
- I'm sorry, My Lord.
- Shh, shh.

279
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,791
Did he hurt you?

280
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,929
No, My Lord.

281
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,732
It's Mhaegen.

282
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:58,134
Who?

283
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,872
She works for you.

284
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:05,509
She's the one--
the Gold Cloaks,

285
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,844
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

286
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,547
That was...

287
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,783
poorly handled.

288
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,454
Sometimes those
with the most power

289
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,190
have the least grace.

290
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:22,794
I can't stop
thinking about it.

291
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,930
I can't sleep.

292
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:29,434
That poor little baby.

293
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,270
You know, you remind me
of another girl,

294
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,339
a lovely thing
I once acquired

295
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:37,375
from a Lysene
pleasure house--

296
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,545
beautiful, like yourself,

297
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,115
and intelligent,
like yourself.

298
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,018
But she wasn't happy.

299
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:51,423
She cried often.

300
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:55,560
I asked her why,
but we didn't have

301
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:58,464
the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

302
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:04,403
Yes, it was quite sad.

303
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:09,409
Girls from the Lysene
pleasure houses are expensive,

304
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:11,578
extremely expensive.

305
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:15,249
And this one wasn't
making me any money.

306
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,022
I hate bad investments.

307
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:25,091
Really, I-- I do.

308
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,160
They haunt me.

309
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:34,267
I had no idea
how to make her happy,

310
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:37,369
no idea how
to mitigate my losses.

311
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,006
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me

312
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,641
a tremendous
amount of money

313
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:47,646
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

314
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:51,450
To use her
in ways that...

315
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,220
Would never occur
to most men.

316
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:58,624
And you know what
occurs to most men.

317
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:06,699
I would not say he succeeded in
making her happy,

318
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:11,337
but my losses were
definitely mitigated.

319
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,280
Take tonight off
to mourn Mhaegen's child.

320
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,750
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

321
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,553
And you'll be happy?

322
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,059
That makes me happy.

323
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:46,505
<i>More wine?</i>

324
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,541
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, My Lord.

325
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:53,612
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
know how to pour our own wine.

326
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,182
That's your new squire?

327
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,250
I could've found you
a proper lad.

328
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:01,020
Myself, I prefer
the improper ones.

329
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:04,057
Mm, that's a good red.
Dornish?

330
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:05,558
You know your wines,
My Lord.

331
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,093
That I do.

332
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:09,930
A fine dinner, My Lord.

333
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:11,899
Call me Tyrion, please.

334
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,768
I'm sure you're getting
used to fine dinners,

335
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:15,336
now that you're a lord.

336
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:17,238
Maybe I'll hire
this cook of yours.

337
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:19,274
Wars have been
started for less.

338
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,446
I heard there was some trouble in
Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

339
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,614
Mm, nasty business.

340
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:28,616
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

341
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,884
The City Watch
must keep the peace,

342
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:34,787
only I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

343
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:38,357
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

344
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,459
Especially
the queen's orders.

345
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,261
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

346
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:46,799
No, but who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

347
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,467
She's always been
a jealous woman.

348
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:50,502
You know your sister
better than I do.

349
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:52,571
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

350
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:54,240
I don't listen to filth.

351
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:57,543
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

352
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:00,479
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

353
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:03,181
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

354
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,284
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

355
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,486
I appreciate
your loyalty.

356
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:13,090
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

357
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,960
in the throne room,
did you give the order?

358
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:18,962
I did.

359
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,697
And I would again.

360
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:22,532
The man was a traitor.

361
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,535
He tried to buy
my loyalty.

362
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,737
The fool.

363
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:28,906
He had no idea
you were already bought.

364
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,142
Are you drunk?

365
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:33,345
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp!

366
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,483
I'm not questioning
Your Honor, Lord Janos.

367
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,186
I'm denying its existence.

368
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,322
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf--

369
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:45,091
Dwarf? Mm, you should
have stopped at Imp.

370
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:47,794
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

371
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:50,197
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

372
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,233
I intend to serve
as Hand of the King

373
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,934
until my father
returns from the war.

374
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:57,069
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

375
00:27:57,104 --> 00:28:00,005
well, I just wouldn't
feel safe with you lurking about.

376
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,540
What are you t--

377
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,343
my friends at court
will not allow this!

378
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,478
- The queen herself has granted--
- The <i>queen regent.</i>

379
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:08,381
And you're a fool to believe
she is your friend.

380
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,751
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

381
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:13,854
No, we shan't.

382
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:22,697
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

383
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:26,366
From there I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

384
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,536
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

385
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,438
I found it
surprisingly beautiful...

386
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:35,409
In a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

387
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:36,977
The lads will escort you.

388
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:38,879
The streets aren't safe
at night, My Lord.

389
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:41,282
These men are
under my command!

390
00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:43,484
I command you to arrest
this cutthroat.

391
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:45,353
His name is Bronn

392
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:47,688
and he is the new
commander of the City Watch.

393
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:49,356
Boys.

394
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:53,894
I have friends at court,

395
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,464
powerful friends!

396
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:59,066
The king himself
made me a lord!

397
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:06,274
To the new Commander.

398
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:16,351
If I told you to murder
an infant girl, say,

399
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:19,621
still at her
mother's breast,

400
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:22,590
would you do it
without question?

401
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:26,628
Without question? No.

402
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:28,963
I'd ask, "how much?"

403
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,717
If they come back,
I say we yield.

404
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,052
Gendry's the one
they want.

405
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:52,154
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

406
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:53,788
I ain't afraid
of no battles.

407
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:56,457
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

408
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:57,992
I've seen
lots of battles.

409
00:29:58,026 --> 00:29:59,693
- I saw--
- Liar.

410
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,963
I saw a man
kill another man

411
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:04,365
just outside a tavern
in Flea Bottom.

412
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,801
Stabbed him
right in the neck.

413
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,637
Two men fighting
isn't a battle.

414
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:12,507
- They had armor on.
- So?

415
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,043
So, if they've got armor on,
it's a battle.

416
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,845
No, it isn't.

417
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:19,481
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

418
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,783
Gendry's an armorer's
apprentice.

419
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:24,719
Hot pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

420
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:29,057
It's, um, when
they've got armor on.

421
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:31,893
<i>Who told you that?</i>

422
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:33,361
A knight.

423
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:36,031
How'd you know
he was a knight?

424
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,702
Well, it was 'cause
he got armor on.

425
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,770
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor.

426
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:44,472
Any idiot
can buy armor.

427
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:46,241
<i>How do you know?</i>

428
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,376
'Cause I sold armor.

429
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:02,756
What do the Gold Cloaks
want with you?

430
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,626
- No idea.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

431
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,961
You know, you shouldn't insult
people that are bigger than you.

432
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,631
Then I wouldn't get
to insult anyone.

433
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:13,033
I don't care
what any of them want.

434
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,802
No good's ever come
of their questions.

435
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:17,037
No good's <i>ever</i> come?

436
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,073
Who asked questions
before?

437
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:22,409
How can someone so small be such
a huge pain in my ass?

438
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:24,511
Who asked questions?

439
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:28,081
The Hand of the King.

440
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:30,317
Hands of the King.

441
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,520
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

442
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:38,091
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

443
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,060
Lord Stark?

444
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:44,364
See? Asking me
questions is bad luck.

445
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:48,300
You'll probably
be dead soon.

446
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,603
- What did they ask about?
- My mom.

447
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:54,306
- Who's your mom?
- Just my mom--

448
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,375
worked in a tavern,
died when I was little.

449
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:57,876
And who was your father?

450
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:01,279
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

451
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:03,414
What about you anyway?

452
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:06,550
You thought
they were after you.

453
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,385
Why?

454
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,954
Did you kill someone or is it
just because you're a girl?

455
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:14,257
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

456
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,906
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

457
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,100
Stupider.

458
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:20,183
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

459
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:21,121
Yeah, that's true,
but you're still a girl.

460
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:21,646
I am not!

461
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,901
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

462
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,238
I don't need
to take a piss.

463
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,514
Lommy and hot pie
can't know.

464
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:36,982
No one can know.

465
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:40,920
Well, they won't,
not from me.

466
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:46,091
My name's not Arry.

467
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,893
It's Arya...
of House Stark.

468
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:54,164
Yoren is taking me home
to Winterfell.

469
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:57,467
He was your father--
the Hand, the traitor.

470
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,535
He was never a traitor.

471
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:01,603
Joffrey is a liar.

472
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,972
So you're a highborn, then.
You're a lady.

473
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,974
No. I mean, yes.

474
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,443
My mother was a lady
and my sister--

475
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:08,944
Yeah, but you were
a lord's daughter

476
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:11,046
and you lived
in a castle and you--

477
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:13,783
look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said--

478
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,085
and I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

479
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,921
I-- I should be
calling you "My Lady."

480
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,924
- Do not call me "My Lady."
- As My Lady commands.

481
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,893
Well, that was unladylike.

482
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,196
Oh!

483
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,125
What's she carrying?

484
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,861
Myrish oranges,

485
00:33:57,895 --> 00:34:00,931
wine from the Arbor...

486
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:04,401
And the heir to Pyke
and the Iron Islands.

487
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,839
The only living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

488
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,077
Me.

489
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:18,680
I don't like wine.

490
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:20,816
Woman's drink.

491
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:25,188
I need to get to Pyke.

492
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,100
I'll find you a horse.

493
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:50,982
I'm heading that way.
I can take you there.

494
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:53,685
I bet you can.

495
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,553
Have you been
at sea long?

496
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:58,123
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

497
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:00,559
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

498
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,261
Maybe you don't know
what you're like.

499
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,331
Maybe you need
someone to teach you.

500
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,500
Do you know who I am?

501
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:11,771
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

502
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:15,074
Lord Greyjoy?

503
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:19,512
Have my things sent up
to the castle.

504
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:38,398
You should give me
the reins.

505
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:40,300
I'm a better rider
than you.

506
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,435
I've been on horseback
for the past 9 years.

507
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,937
9 years?

508
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:46,439
Do you still know
your way around a ship?

509
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:48,508
Have these hands
ever touched a rope?

510
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:51,010
Don't you worry
about my hands.

511
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,947
The sea is in my blood.

512
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:58,284
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

513
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:01,487
I have a proposal
for my father,

514
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,191
one that will
make him king again,

515
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:06,293
and me after him.

516
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:10,998
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

517
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:13,167
Is that an offer
from my future king?

518
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:15,770
An order from
your future king.

519
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,675
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

520
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,844
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

521
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:39,191
Father.

522
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:42,394
9 years, is it?

523
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:44,430
They took
a frightened boy.

524
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:47,300
<i>What have</i>
<i>they given back?</i>

525
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,737
A man.

526
00:36:50,772 --> 00:36:54,175
- Your blood and your heir.
- <i>We shall see.</i>

527
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:58,247
Stark had you
longer than I did.

528
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:00,449
<i>Lord Stark is gone.</i>

529
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:05,254
And how do you feel
about that?

530
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,593
What's done is done.

531
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,662
I've brought you
a proposal from Robb Stark.

532
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,831
Who gave you
those clothes?

533
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:19,335
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

534
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,304
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

535
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,006
You will.

536
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,577
That bauble
'round your neck--

537
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:30,747
did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

538
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,550
<i>I asked a question.</i>

539
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,220
<i>Did you pull it from the neck</i>
<i>of a corpse you made</i>

540
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,858
or did you buy it
to match your fine clothes?

541
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,962
Iron or gold?

542
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,333
Gold.

543
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,007
I'll not have my son
dressed as a whore.

544
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,478
My fears have come true--

545
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,747
the Starks
have made you theirs.

546
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,052
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

547
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,355
like a trained raven
clutching his message.

548
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,357
The offer he makes
is one I proposed.

549
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,960
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

550
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:17,562
hunted with him,
fought at his side.

551
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,231
He thinks of me
as a brother.

552
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:21,901
No, not here,
not in my hearing.

553
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,436
You will not
name him brother,

554
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:28,407
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

555
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:31,277
Or have you forgotten
your own blood?

556
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,279
I forget nothing.

557
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,182
I remember my brothers.

558
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:39,152
And I remember
when my father was a king.

559
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:57,238
I see.

560
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:59,874
I destroy Robb Stark's
enemies for him

561
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:03,311
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

562
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:07,147
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

563
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,783
I'm your son,
your only living heir.

564
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:12,252
Who else?

565
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:16,389
I told you to wait outside.

566
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:19,826
How did you get
past the guards?

567
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,261
Anything with a cock
is easy to fool.

568
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,065
My dear.

569
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,836
Yara?

570
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:32,739
So good to see you,
brother.

571
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,409
This is a homecoming I'll tell
my grandchildren about.

572
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:40,347
She can't lead an attack!

573
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:43,617
- And why not?
- You're a woman!

574
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:47,087
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

575
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:49,623
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

576
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:52,526
after your new father
killed him.

577
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:56,263
What's dead may never die.

578
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:58,299
The only nights she's spent
off these islands

579
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,334
have been spent
on the sea.

580
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,370
<i>She's commanded men.</i>

581
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:05,439
<i>She's killed men.</i>

582
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:07,608
She knows who she is.

583
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:12,713
No man gives me
a crown.

584
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:15,950
I pay the iron price.

585
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:17,918
I will take my crown,

586
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:21,222
for that is who I am.

587
00:40:21,256 --> 00:40:23,691
That is who
we have always been.

588
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,399
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

589
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:33,302
Who said anything
about the Lannisters?

590
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:42,380
<i>You'll have your gold</i>

591
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:44,048
<i>when we take the treasury</i>
<i>at King's Landing.</i>

592
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:45,850
All these kings
fighting for the throne,

593
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:48,820
and this Stannis
has the smallest army.

594
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:50,821
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

595
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:54,158
Because you're
a smart gambler.

596
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:57,161
Stannis has proved
himself in war twice.

597
00:40:57,195 --> 00:41:00,464
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

598
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,266
Neither has
the false King Joffrey.

599
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:04,268
And yet they both
have larger armies.

600
00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:06,270
Stannis has just
begun the fight.

601
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,906
His Bannermen
will rally to his cause.

602
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:12,642
There's no man
in the Seven Kingdoms

603
00:41:12,676 --> 00:41:14,244
more honorable
than Stannis Baratheon

604
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:15,678
or more worthy
of loyalty.

605
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:17,279
What is the world
coming to

606
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:19,915
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

607
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,351
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

608
00:41:22,385 --> 00:41:23,919
You think I'm insulted?

609
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:26,955
I <i>am</i> a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

610
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,625
<i>I don't sail</i>
<i>for promises.</i>

611
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,059
Of course you do.

612
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:33,762
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise--

613
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:35,263
a promise that
somewhere on the sea,

614
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,699
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

615
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:40,502
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

616
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,772
You're not a young man,
Salladhor.

617
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,607
And correct me
if I'm wrong--

618
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,342
most pirates
don't grow old.

619
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,478
Only the clever ones.

620
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:51,414
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

621
00:41:51,448 --> 00:41:53,549
stealing from
Pentoshi cheesemongers

622
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:54,918
and Meereenese
silk merchants?

623
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:57,019
Then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

624
00:41:57,054 --> 00:41:58,755
That's easy.

625
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:01,324
What I'm offering you
is hard.

626
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,896
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

627
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,632
You'll be the richest man
in Lys and the most famous.

628
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:13,536
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

629
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:17,473
"Salladhor Saan"
is a good name for songs.

630
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:21,076
- It is.
- <i>One thing-- I want the queen.</i>

631
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,912
- The queen?
- Cersei-- I want her.

632
00:42:23,947 --> 00:42:26,414
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

633
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,750
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

634
00:42:28,784 --> 00:42:32,053
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

635
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:33,922
This war
isn't about you.

636
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:37,258
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

637
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:40,094
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

638
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:42,263
As if she would
just let you.

639
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:43,964
You don't know
how persuasive I am.

640
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:46,266
I've never tried
to fuck you.

641
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:51,605
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

642
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,006
the one true God--

643
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,607
I've been all over
the world, my boy,

644
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:57,310
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true Gods.

645
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:59,512
They all think
they found the right one.

646
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:02,849
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

647
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:05,452
and better yet,
a queen's legs.

648
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,056
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

649
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:10,791
Eh, he's young yet.

650
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:14,829
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

651
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:16,598
I cannot promise you
the queen.

652
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:21,803
You believe
your king can win?

653
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:24,038
He is the one true king.

654
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:25,873
You Westerosi
are funny people.

655
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,275
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

656
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,647
I'll sail with you,
Davos Seaworth.

657
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,284
You're the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

658
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:39,519
Make me rich.

659
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:42,956
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

660
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,404
<i>When will the king</i>
<i>have us sail?</i>

661
00:43:56,438 --> 00:43:58,773
As soon as his God
wills it.

662
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:01,443
He's my God, too,
and yours,

663
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,146
but you are
too blind to see.

664
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,283
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

665
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:09,984
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

666
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:12,219
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

667
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:14,021
I wish I had
a God, truly.

668
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:16,724
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
men pray to every God there is--

669
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,159
pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home.

670
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,962
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

671
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:25,933
- I wasn't praying.
- No, but I was.

672
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:29,069
Every night
that you were at sea,

673
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,206
I lit a candle
and I prayed for you.

674
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:34,941
You want me
to have a God?

675
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:38,111
Fine. King Stannis
is my God.

676
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,613
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

677
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:43,216
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

678
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:45,252
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

679
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:48,555
You think a fire God
commanded all that?

680
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:51,991
It was Stannis,
only Stannis.

681
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:54,894
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

682
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:57,896
Don't tell him that.

683
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,867
Lord Janos Slynt was
commander of the City Watch.

684
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:03,302
You had no right
to exile him.

685
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:05,037
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

686
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:07,606
You're serving as the King's Hand
till father gets here.

687
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,208
I am Queen Regent.

688
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:10,910
Listen to me,
Queen Regent.

689
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:13,346
You're losing the people.

690
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,483
- Do you hear me?
- The people.

691
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,285
You think I care?

692
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,987
You might
find it difficult

693
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,890
to rule over millions
who want you dead.

694
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:23,791
Half the city will starve
when winter comes.

695
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:25,360
The other half will plot
to overthrow you.

696
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:28,396
<i>And your gold-plated thugs</i>
<i>just gave them</i>

697
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:30,232
their rallying cry--

698
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:32,868
"The Queen
slaughters babies."

699
00:45:34,804 --> 00:45:38,440
You don't even have
the decency to deny it.

700
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:51,520
It wasn't you who gave
the order, was it?

701
00:45:51,555 --> 00:45:53,422
<i>Joffrey didn't</i>
<i>even tell you.</i>

702
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,794
Did he tell you?

703
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:59,163
I imagine that
would be even worse.

704
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:02,133
He did what needed
to be done.

705
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,203
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

706
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:08,105
This is what ruling is--
lying on a bed of weeds,

707
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,574
ripping them out
by the root, one by one,

708
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:12,175
before they strangle you
in your sleep.

709
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,744
I'm no king, but I think there's more
to ruling than that.

710
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:16,779
I don't care
what you think!

711
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,381
You've never
taken it seriously.

712
00:46:18,415 --> 00:46:20,749
You haven't,
Jaime hasn't.

713
00:46:24,254 --> 00:46:26,288
It's all fallen on me.

714
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:34,130
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

715
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:41,471
You're funny.

716
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:47,344
You've always
been funny...

717
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:49,313
<i>But none of your jokes</i>
<i>will ever match</i>

718
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:51,548
the first one, will they?

719
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,452
You remember?

720
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,188
Back when you ripped
my mother open

721
00:46:57,222 --> 00:46:59,923
on your way out of her
and she bled to death?

722
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:04,094
She was my mother, too.

723
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:06,196
Mother gone...

724
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:10,100
For the sake of you.

725
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:16,106
<i>There's no bigger joke</i>
<i>in the world than that.</i>

726
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:40,465
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

727
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:42,633
How did you fare
with your pirate?

728
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:46,104
Salladhor Saan will join
our fleet-- 30 ships.

729
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:48,139
His men know
how to fight.

730
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:51,576
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

731
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:53,245
It does seem
the wiser choice.

732
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:55,714
There won't be
a choice this time.

733
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,651
Do you trust him?

734
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:00,386
Salladhor Saan
is an old friend.

735
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,388
I've known him 30 years.

736
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,690
I've never trusted him,

737
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:08,828
but once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

738
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:12,098
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

739
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:16,870
Leave us.

740
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:24,612
At once, Your Grace.

741
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,822
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

742
00:48:40,495 --> 00:48:42,129
Come.

743
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,470
What did you say to him?

744
00:48:50,504 --> 00:48:53,940
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

745
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:57,177
- Why?
- <i>Because it is true.</i>

746
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,979
You're troubled, my king.

747
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:02,181
Yeah.

748
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:04,851
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

749
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:07,854
Tell your lord
to burn them, then.

750
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:09,322
I tell him nothing.

751
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:12,559
I pray for his commands
and I obey.

752
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:18,231
My little brother has 100,000
men according to the scouts,

753
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:21,468
men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

754
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,403
<i>You must have faith.</i>

755
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,472
Faith?

756
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:29,042
<i>In a real war, the side</i>
<i>with the greater number wins</i>

757
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:31,011
9 times out of 10.

758
00:49:31,045 --> 00:49:32,679
Then we must be
the 10th.

759
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:37,051
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

760
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:40,555
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

761
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:45,727
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

762
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:50,598
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

763
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:53,968
I've said the words,
damn you.

764
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:59,340
I burnt the idols.

765
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:06,614
You must give
all of yourself.

766
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,120
I have a wife.

767
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:16,324
I took a vow.

768
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:21,862
She's sickly, weak...

769
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,500
Shut away in a tower.

770
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:28,636
She disgusts you.

771
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,675
And she's given
you nothing--

772
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:39,447
no sons,
only stillborns,

773
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:41,649
only death.

774
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:52,092
I will give you
a son, my king.

775
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,530
A son?
